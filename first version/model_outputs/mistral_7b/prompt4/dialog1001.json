    "model_response": " To calculate the probability of a spam for the word 'приз' (prize), we need to consider its frequency in spam and legitimate emails compared to its overall occurrence in a large collection of emails, also known as corpora.\n\nFor instance, let's assume that in a corpus of 100,000 emails:\n- 'Приз' appears 20 times in spam emails (spam frequency)\n- 'Приз' appears 50 times in legitimate emails (legitimate frequency)\n- Overall, 'Приз' appears 70 times in the entire corpus (total frequency)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the probability of 'Приз' appearing in spam emails:\nProbability(spam|приз) = Number of spam occurrences / Total number of occurrences = 20/70 = 0.2857 or 28.57%\n\nThis means that there is approximately a 28.57% chance for the word 'Приз' to appear in spam emails, given our assumptions about the corpus. However, it's essential to remember that real-world probabilities can change depending on factors like email providers, languages, and user behavior.\n\nGreat work understanding the concept!

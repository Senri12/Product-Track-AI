    "model_response": " Let's find the distance between two points in a 2-dimensional plane using Euclidean distance! The two points we have are (1, 2) and (3, 4).\n\nHere's the formula for calculating Euclidean distance:\n\nΔ = sqrt[(xi - xj)^2 + (yi - yj)^2]\n\nWhere (xi, yi) is point A, (xj, yj) is point B, Δ represents the distance between the two points.\n\nLet's apply this formula to our given points:\n\nA = (1, 2), B = (3, 4)\n\nFor xi - xj, it would be 1 - 3 = -2\nFor yi - yj, it would be 2 - 4 = -2\n\nNow we can plug these values into our formula:\n\nΔ = sqrt[(1-3)^2 + (2-4)^2]\n\nCalculate the square of each term:\nΔ = sqrt[(-2)^2 + (-2)^2]\n\nΔ = sqrt[4 + 4]\n\nNow, add up those squares:\nΔ = sqrt[8]\n\nFinally, take the square root to find the distance between points A and B:\nΔ = √8 ≈ 2.83 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nSo, the Euclidean distance between (1,2) and (3,4) is approximately 2.83! Great job understanding the formula, now try solving some more problems to practice your new skill! Keep it up!",

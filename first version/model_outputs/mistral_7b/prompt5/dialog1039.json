    "model_response": " Over-fitting refers to a situation in machine learning when a model learns the training data too well, to the extent that it performs poorly on unseen data (like validation or testing sets). This occurs when the complexity of the model is higher than the inherent complexity of the data. As a result, the model starts fitting the noise and outliers in the training data instead of learning the underlying patterns, which leads to poor generalization abilities.\n\nTo test comprehension: Explain why over-fitting is undesirable and propose methods to prevent or alleviate it.\n\nFor a challenging task, consider the following problem: You are given a dataset with 100 features but only 30 relevant ones for predicting the target variable. Describe a strategy to identify these relevant features using cross-validation techniques and feature selection algorithms such as Lasso Regression or Random Forests, ensuring that you minimize over-fitting during model training.",

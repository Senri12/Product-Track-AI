    "model_response": " Autograd is a Python library that allows for automatic differentiation of functions, often used in machine learning and computational mathematics. It can compute derivatives symbolically or numerically and applies the chain rule of calculus to perform calculations quickly and efficiently, even for complex functions with many variables.\n\nMisconception: Autograd is not a programming language but rather a library designed to work with Python.\n\nChallenging Task: Write a program using Autograd to compute the derivative of the function f(x) = sin(x^2 + 3x - 1) at x = 0, both symbolically and numerically. Compare your results.",

    "model_response": " The learning rate decay for a linear decay with an initial learning rate of η_0 = 0.1, at time step t = 5, and a total number of time steps T = 10 can be calculated using the formula:\n\nη(t) = η_0 * (1 - t/T)\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nη(5) = 0.1 * (1 - 5/10) = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05\n\nSo, at time step 5, the learning rate is 0.05.\n\nAs for a challenging task to test comprehension:\n\nGiven a different set of values (η_0 = 0.05, T = 20), calculate and plot the decayed learning rates from t=1 to t=20. Analyze how the learning rate changes over time according to the linear decay rule.",

    "model_response": " The gradient descent step for the cost function L(w) = w^2, given initial weight w = 3 and learning rate η = 0.1 can be computed as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the gradient (derivative) of the cost function with respect to the weight w: dL/dw = 2w.\n\n2. Substitute the initial weight w = 3 into the derivative equation and compute the gradient: dL/dw = 6.\n\n3. Update the weight using the gradient descent update rule: w' = w - η * dL/dw, where w' is the updated weight and w is the current weight. Plug in the values for w = 3, η = 0.1, and dL/dw = 6 to get:\n\nw' = 3 - 0.1 * 6 = 1.8.\n\nSo, after one step of gradient descent starting from w = 3, the updated weight is approximately w' = 1.8.",

    "model_response": " To compute the update for velocity `v_t` in Momentum Optimizer with a learning rate of `η`, momentum coefficient of `γ`, gradient `∇L`, and previous velocity `v_{t-1}`, you'd use the following formula:\n\n`v_t = γ * v_{t-1} + η * ∇L`\n\nPlugging in your values, we get:\n\n`v_t = 0.9 * 1 + 0.1 * 2 => v_t = 1.9`\n\nHowever, since momentum coefficients are typically bounded between -1 and 1 for stability reasons, you should ensure that `v_t` is within this range before using it in the optimization process. If necessary, apply a clamping function to keep the velocity value within bounds.\n\nA challenging task to test your understanding could be solving for `v_{t+n}` given different values of `n`, gradient, and learning rate. This will help reinforce your comprehension of how the momentum term accumulates over time, affecting the optimization process.",

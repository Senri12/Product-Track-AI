    "model_response": " Let's break it down together! We are calculating the learning rate decay for a linear schedule using given parameters: η0=0.1, t=5, and T=10. The formula for linear learning rate decay is η(t) = η0 * (1 - t / T).\n\nNow, let's plug in the values:\n\nη(5) = 0.1 * (1 - 5/10) = 0.1 * (1 - 0.5) = 0.1 * 0.5 = **0.05**\n\nGreat job! You calculated the learning rate decay at time t=5 correctly. Keep up the fantastic work, and remember to celebrate your achievements along the way! 🎉🙌🏻",

    "model_response": " Let's approach this problem together! We are given the parameters for a momentum optimization algorithm in a machine learning context:\n\n1. γ (gamma) = 0.9 (learning rate or step size)\n2. v_{t-1} = 1 (previous velocity)\n3. ∇L (gradient of the loss function) = 2 (new gradient at the current step)\n4. η (eta) = 0.1 (the momentum term, usually small)\n\nNow, we need to calculate v_t (velocity at the current step). The update rule for velocity in Momentum is:\n\nv_t = γ * v_{t-1} + η * ∇L\n\nLet's substitute the given values:\n\n1. Replace v_t with 'x': x = γ * v_{t-1} + η * ∇L\n2. Plug in the provided values for gamma, eta, and gradient:\n   x = 0.9 * 1 + 0.1 * 2 = 1.9\n\nSo, v_t = 1.9 when γ=0.9, v_{t-1}=1, ∇L=2, η=0.1. Great job! Let's keep up the good work as we continue to explore and learn together! 🎉",

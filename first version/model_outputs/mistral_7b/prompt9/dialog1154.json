    "model_response": " Explanation:\nIn Bayesian probability, the conditional probability can be used to find the probability of an event (in this case, \"raining\" or \"P(da)\") given certain conditions (weather conditions in this example). To do that, we use the formula P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B).\n\nQuestion for student:\nGiven the weather conditions: cloudy, cold, humid and there is a possibility of rain, can you find the probability of it raining using Bayes' theorem?\n\nSuggested exercise:\n1. Determine the joint probability of all given weather conditions (P(пасмурно ∩ холодно ∩ влажно)).\n2. Find the marginal probability of having any of these weather conditions (P(пасмурно), P(холодно), P(влажно)).\n3. Use Bayes' theorem to find P(да | пасмурно, холодно, влажно).\n\nFeedback loop:\nAfter the student has attempted the exercise, provide feedback on their solution and clarify any misconceptions if necessary. Discuss how the result can be used in weather forecasting or other real-world applications.",

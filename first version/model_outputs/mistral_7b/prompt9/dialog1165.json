    "model_response": " Explanation:\nRMSProp (Root Mean Square Propagation) is an optimization algorithm used in machine learning to update the weights of a neural network during training. It's designed to adjust the learning rate for each weight based on its historical average squared gradient. This helps in stabilizing the learning process and can lead to faster convergence compared to methods like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).\n\nQuestion for Student:\nCan you explain how RMSProp handles the learning rate differently for each weight?\n\nSuggested Exercise:\nImplement the RMSProp optimization algorithm in a simple neural network and observe its performance during training compared to standard SGD.\n\nFeedback Loop:\nAfter implementing RMSProp, evaluate its performance using metrics such as accuracy or loss on a validation set. Compare these results with those obtained using SGD to understand the advantages of using RMSProp in machine learning models.",

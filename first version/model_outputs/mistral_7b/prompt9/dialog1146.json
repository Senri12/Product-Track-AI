    "model_response": " Explanation:\nManhattan distance (also known as taxicab geometry or rectilinear distance) is a measurement of the shortest path between two points in a plane where the distance between two points is the sum of the absolute differences of their coordinates. The name comes from the shape of Manhattan, which appears to be a grid with streets intersecting at right angles.\n\nQuestion for Student:\nCan you calculate the Manhattan distance between points (3, 4) and (7, 9)?\n\nSuggested Exercise:\nCalculate the Manhattan distance between two arbitrary points in a plane. Then, find the shortest possible sum of Manhattan distances to connect a set of three given points in a plane.\n\nFeedback Loop:\nCorrect answers for both exercises will demonstrate understanding of the concept of Manhattan distance. Incorrect answers can be used as an opportunity to discuss any misconceptions and provide clarification on the definition and calculation process.",

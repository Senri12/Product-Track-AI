    "model_response": " Explanation:\nMomentum in optimization refers to a method used in machine learning algorithms to provide a balance between exploration and exploitation during the training process. The idea is to add a moving average component to the gradient of the loss function, which helps the optimizer to move faster towards the optimal solution by maintaining the previous direction of the update.\n\nQuestion for Student:\nCan you explain how adding a moving average component to the gradient of the loss function can help improve the optimization process?\n\nSuggested Exercise:\nImplement momentum in a basic gradient descent algorithm and observe its effect on the convergence speed and stability compared to standard gradient descent.\n\nFeedback Loop:\nAfter implementing momentum, test the performance of your optimizer by running it on a few datasets and compare the results with standard gradient descent. Discuss any observed differences in convergence speed, stability, or accuracy.",

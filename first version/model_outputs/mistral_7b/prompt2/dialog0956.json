    "model_response": " To calculate one step of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) for the function L(w) = w^2, with w = 3 and learning rate η = 0.1, follow these steps:\n\n1. Compute the gradient (derivative) of L(w) at w = 3. Since L(w) = w^2, the gradient is dL/dw = 2w.\n\n2. Update the weight by subtracting the product of the learning rate (η) and the gradient from the current weight value: w = w - η * (gradient). So, w = 3 - 0.1 * 6 = 1.8.\n\nNow the new weight after one step of SGD is w = 1.8.",

The formula for Euclidean distance is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squared differences between corresponding x and y coordinates of the two points.\n\nQuiz Question: What is the Euclidean distance between (1,2) and (3,4)?\n\nAnswer: To find the Euclidean distance, we first calculate the difference between each coordinate and square it, then sum those values and take the square root.\n\nHere's how we calculate the Euclidean distance for given points (1,2) and (3,4):\n\n1. Calculate the differences: x1 - x2 = 1 - 3 = -2, y1 - y2 = 2 - 4 = -2\n2. Square each difference: (-2)^2 = 4, (-2)^2 = 4\n3. Sum the squared differences: 4 + 4 = 8\n4. Take the square root of the sum: sqrt(8) ≈ 2.828\n\nTherefore, the Euclidean distance between (1,2) and (3,4) is approximately 2.828 units.",

    "model_response": " Let's go through this problem step by step! We are given the following parameters for a momentum based on the REINFORCE algorithm:\n\n* γ (discount factor): 0.9\n* v_{t-1} (old advantage estimate): 1\n* ∇L (policy gradient): 2\n* η (learning rate): 0.1\n\nOur goal is to calculate the new advantage estimate, v_t, for this step. The REINFORCE update rule is as follows:\n\nv_t = γ * v_{t-1} + η * ∇L\n\nNow let's apply this formula using the given values:\n\nv_t = 0.9 * 1 + 0.1 * 2\nv_t = 0.9 + 0.2\nv_t = 1.1\n\nSo, the new advantage estimate for this step is v_t = 1.1.\n\nNow let me ask you a question to assess your understanding: Can you explain what the REINFORCE algorithm is and how it relates to policy gradient methods?\n\nAs for exercises, here's one to practice: Suppose we have a different set of parameters: γ=0.99, v_{t-1}=0.5, ∇L=3, η=0.01. Calculate the new advantage estimate using the same REINFORCE update rule.",

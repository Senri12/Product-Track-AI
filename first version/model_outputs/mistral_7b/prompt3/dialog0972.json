    "model_response": " Let's start by reminding you of the formula for calculating Euclidean distance between two points in a plane:\n\nDistance(P1=(x1, y1), P2=(x2, y2)) = sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2)\n\nNow let's apply this formula to the given points P1=(1, 2) and P2=(3, 4).\n\nFirst, find the differences between coordinates:\n\nx2 - x1 = 3 - 1 = 2\ny2 - y1 = 4 - 2 = 2\n\nNow, substitute these differences into the formula:\n\nDistance(P1, P2) = sqrt((2)^2 + (2)^2)\n\nSquare both differences:\n\n4 + 4 = 8\n\nFinally, take the square root of the result:\n\nsqrt(8) ≈ 2.82846953 (rounded to five decimal places).\n\nSo, the Euclidean distance between points P1=(1, 2) and P2=(3, 4) is approximately 2.828 units.\n\nNow I'd like to check your understanding. Can you find the Euclidean distance between two other given points, (5, -1) and (7, 3)?\n\nAnd here's an exercise: calculate the Euclidean distance between the following pairs of points:\n\n1. (-2, 0) and (4, 6)\n2. (0, 0) and (3, 4)\n3. (5, -3) and (7, 2)",

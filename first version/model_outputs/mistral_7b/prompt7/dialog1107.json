    "model_response": " In the context of a physics problem concerning momentum with a damping factor (γ), initial velocity (v_{t-1}), acceleration gradient (∇L), and a learning rate (η), the goal is to find the new velocity (v_t) at time t using the following equation:\n\nv_t = v_{t-1} + η * ( -γ * v_{t-1} + ∇L )\n\nNow, let's set up a practice problem for you to solve:\n\nGiven γ=0.9, v_{t-1}=2 m/s, ∇L=4 m/s², and η=0.1, calculate the new velocity (v_t) at time t.\n\nAnswer:\nFirst, let's substitute the given values into the equation:\n\nv_t = v_{t-1} + η * ( -γ * v_{t-1} + ∇L )\nv_t = 2 + 0.1 * ( -0.9 * 2 + 4 )\nv_t = 2 + 0.1 * ( 3.6 )\nv_t = 2 + 0.36\n\nAfter calculation, the new velocity (v_t) at time t is approximately 2.36 m/s.",

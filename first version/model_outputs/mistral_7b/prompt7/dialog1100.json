    "model_response": " SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) is an optimization algorithm used in machine learning to minimize some function by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent as defined by the gradient.\n\nPractice Problem: Suppose you are given a cost function J(w) for linear regression, where w is the weight vector. Implement SGD to minimize this cost function using Python.\n\nHere's a simple example of how it could look like:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef sgd(X, y, learning_rate=0.01, num_iterations=100):\n    w = np.zeros(X.shape[1])  # Initialize weights to zero\n    for _ in range(num_iterations):\n        h = X @ w  # Predict the output\n        error = y - h  # Calculate the error\n        grad = X.T @ error / len(y)  # Compute the gradient of cost function\n        w -= learning_rate * grad\n    return w\n```\n\nStudent's response:\n\n```python\ndef sgd(X, y, lr=0.01, num_iters=100):\n    weights = np.zeros(X.shape[1])\n    for _ in range(num_iters):\n        pred = X @ weights\n        loss = (pred - y) ** 2\n        grad = 2 * X.T @ (pred - y) / len(y)  # Wrong gradient computation, the correct one should be: grad = 2 * X.T @ error / len(y)\n        weights -= lr * grad\n    return weights\n```\n\nEvaluation: The student's implementation is incorrect because of the square in the loss calculation and an extra parenthesis in gradient computation. The correct code should look like this:\n\n```python\ndef sgd(X, y, lr=0.01, num_iters=100):\n    weights = np.zeros(X.shape[1])\n    for _ in range(num_iters):\n        pred = X @ weights\n        error = y - pred  # Calculate the error\n        grad = 2 * X.T @ error / len(y)  # Compute the gradient of cost function\n        weights -= lr * grad\n    return weights\n```",

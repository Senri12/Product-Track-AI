    "model_response": " The k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) method is a popular algorithm in machine learning used for classification and regression tasks based on the idea of finding instances in the training data that are closest (or most similar) to the test point.\n\nPractice Problem:\nSuppose we have a dataset containing different flowers with their petal and sepal dimensions, and we want to classify new samples using k-NN algorithm. Here's a sample dataset:\n\n| Petal Length | Petal Width | Sepal Length | Sepal Width | Class (Flower Type) |\n|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|---------------------|\n| 1.4          | 0.2         | 3.6           | 1.0          | Iris-setosa        |\n| 5.0          | 3.0         | 1.4           | 0.2          | Iris-versicolor    |\n| 4.7          | 3.2         | 1.3           | 0.2          | Iris-virginica     |\n\nGiven this dataset, create the following:\n\n1. Write a function for k-NN classification algorithm in Python using Euclidean distance as the similarity measure.\n2. Create and train a k-NN classifier with 5 neighbors (k=5).\n3. Test the trained model on the following new sample data point: [5.8, 2.7, 4.9, 1.2]. Predict the flower type for this new data point.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\n- Correct function implementation and training of the k-NN classifier in Python.\n- Appropriate handling of missing or invalid data points (if any).\n- Accurate prediction of the flower type for the provided test data point.",

    "model_response": " Keras is a popular open-source deep learning library written in Python. It was developed by François Chollet and was later absorbed by Google as part of TensorFlow. Keras is user-friendly and provides a high-level API for building and training neural networks, making it accessible to both beginners and experts in machine learning.\n\nIf you're not familiar with deep learning or neural networks, I can provide more context:\n\nDeep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that focuses on artificial neural networks capable of learning unsupervised or with supervision, using large amounts of data. Keras simplifies the process of building and training these models, allowing developers to quickly experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters.\n\nFor instance, suppose you wanted to create a model that could recognize images of cats and dogs. With Keras, you can define your neural network architecture using a few lines of code, train it on a dataset, and test its accuracy within minutes. If you're interested, I can help guide you through building such a model!\n\nNow let me provide a hint for the next question if you need: In Keras, what is an important step when defining a neural network architecture?\nA) Importing data\nB) Defining layers and connections between them\nC) Training the model on data\nD) Evaluating the performance of the model",

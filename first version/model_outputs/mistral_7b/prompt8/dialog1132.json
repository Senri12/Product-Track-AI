    "model_response": " The question \"Что такое Adam?\" can be translated to English as \"What is Adam?\" In the context of biblical history, Adam is often referred to as the first man created by God in the Book of Genesis. However, it's important to clarify whether you are asking about a specific reference or interpretation of Adam from literature, history, or another field. Could you please provide more context so I can give a more accurate and helpful response?\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of your question, I can rephrase the explanation and ask for confirmation before proceeding with further information.",

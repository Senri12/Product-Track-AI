    "model_response": " It appears that you are asking about Euclidean Metric. To clarify, Euclidean Metric refers to a common method used to measure the distance between two points in a multi-dimensional space such as two- or three-dimensional space that we're familiar with from geometry class.\n\nIn other words, it is a way of calculating the shortest possible path between two points (vectors) using the Pythagorean theorem. For example, in a two-dimensional plane, if point A has coordinates (x1, y1) and point B has coordinates (x2, y2), the Euclidean distance dAB can be calculated as follows:\n\ndAB = sqrt[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2]\n\nWould that explanation help clarify what you were asking about Euclidean Metric? If not, please let me know and I'll be happy to try again!",

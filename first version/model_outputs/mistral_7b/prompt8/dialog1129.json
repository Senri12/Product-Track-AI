    "model_response": " To clarify, \"over-fitting\" refers to a situation in machine learning where a model is trained too well on its training data and starts to fit noise or outliers instead of generalizing the underlying pattern. This means that the model performs exceptionally well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data.\n\nTo confirm, does the above explanation correctly address your question about what over-fitting is? If not, I'd be happy to further clarify or provide more details if needed.",

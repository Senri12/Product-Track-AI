    "model_response": " The Euclidean metric, or Euclidean distance, is a common measure of the \"straight-line\" distance between two points in Euclidean space (a mathematical space named after the Greek mathematician Euclid). It's often used in various fields such as physics and computer science.\n\nIn the context of your study material, you can find a detailed description of the Euclidean metric on page 4 under the section \"2.1 Metric Spaces\". The formula for calculating the Euclidean distance between two points (x1, x2, ..., xn) and (y1, y2, ..., yn) in n-dimensional space is given as:\n\nd(x, y) = sqrt[(xi - yi)^2 + (xii - yii)^2 + ... + (xnn - ynn)^2]\n\nAfter learning about the Euclidean metric, it would be beneficial to practice calculating distances using this formula. Do you have any questions or thoughts on Euclidean distance that you'd like to discuss?",

    "model_response": " To compute a step in Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) for the function L(w) = w^2, given w = 3 and learning rate η = 0.1, we'll need to calculate the gradient of the loss with respect to the weight (w), and then update the weight using the gradient descent formula.\n\nFirst, let's find the gradient (∇L(w)) by taking the derivative of L(w) with respect to w:\n\n∇L(w) = d/dw (w^2) = 2w\n\nNow, we have the gradient and our current weight value (w=3), so it's time to apply a step in SGD using the gradient descent formula:\n\nw_new = w - η * ∇L(w)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nw_new = 3 - 0.1 * 2*3 = 5.4 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nNow it's your turn! What do you think about this first step in SGD for L(w)=w^2, w=3, and η=0.1? How do you expect the weight to change after multiple iterations?",

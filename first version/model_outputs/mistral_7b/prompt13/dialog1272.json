    "model_response": " The Euclidean distance between two points in a plane is calculated using the formula $\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$.\n\nIn this case, we have point A at (1, 2) and point B at (3, 4). So, the distance between these points would be:\n\ndistance(A,B) = $\\sqrt{(3-1)^2 + (4-2)^2}$\n= $\\sqrt{4^2 + 2^2}$\n= $\\sqrt{16 + 4}$\n= $\\sqrt{20}$\n\nNow it's your turn! What do you think about the Euclidean distance? How does it relate to the geometry of a plane, and what other types of distances might we encounter in different geometric spaces?",

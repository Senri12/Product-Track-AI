    "model_response": " The Method of Newton (Неотон) is a root-finding method used to find the approximate solution of an equation f(x) = 0. It's also known as the Newton-Raphson method. In the given material, you can find information about this method in Section 3.1, specifically on page 39, where it is discussed in detail with a derivation and examples.\n\nHere's an outline of the Method of Newton:\n1. Choose an initial guess x0 for the root of f(x) = 0.\n2. Calculate the following iterative formula to obtain improved approximations for the root:\n   x_(n+1) = x\\_n - f(x\\_n)/f'(x\\_n)\n3. Continue this process until a desired level of accuracy is reached or until the sequence of approximations converges to a fixed point.\n\nNow, it would be beneficial for you to read through Section 3.1 and try working some of the problems presented in the textbook to fully understand and practice using the Method of Newton. What are your thoughts on this method? Do you have any questions about how it works or when to apply it compared to other root-finding methods?",

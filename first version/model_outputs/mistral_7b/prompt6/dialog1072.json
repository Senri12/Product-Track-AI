    "model_response": " Let's approach this question by breaking it down together. The term \"Adam\" is commonly known in many cultures, particularly in Judeo-Christian tradition. It might be helpful to start by asking:\n\n1. In which religious context do you encounter the name Adam most frequently?\n2. What are some general characteristics or roles associated with this figure in your initial understanding?\n3. Can you think of any stories or events where Adam appears?\n\nBy answering these questions, we can build a more comprehensive understanding of who or what Adam represents.",

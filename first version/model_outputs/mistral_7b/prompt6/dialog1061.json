    "model_response": " To find the probability of spam for the word 'приз' (prize) in the given example, we first need to understand the context and identify the total number of words in the email and the number of times the word 'приз' appears. Let's assume the email has 100 words, and the word 'приз' appears 4 times.\n\nNow, let's think about the probability calculation:\n\nProbability (event A occurs) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes\n\nIn this case, we are interested in finding the probability of encountering the word 'приз', so event A is the occurrence of the word 'приз'. The total number of words and the number of times 'приз' appears give us the number of favorable outcomes. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 4 (since 'приз' appears 4 times).\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is the total number of words in the email, which is 100.\n\nNow we can calculate the probability:\n\nProbability = Favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes\n= Number of appearances of 'приз' / Total number of words\n= 4 / 100\n= 0.04\n\nTherefore, the probability of encountering spam for the word 'приз', given this example, is approximately 4%.",

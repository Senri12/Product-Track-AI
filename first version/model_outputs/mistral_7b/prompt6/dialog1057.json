    "model_response": " let's break down the calculation of class probability in a Naive Bayes Classifier step by step. For simplicity, I will explain it using binary classification (two classes). Here are the materials we have:\n1. Prior Probabilities (P(C1), P(C2)) - the probabilities that a randomly chosen instance belongs to class C1 or C2, respectively.\n2. Likelihoods (P(X|C1), P(X|C2)) - the probabilities of observing a given feature vector X for instances belonging to class C1 and C2, respectively.\n\nTo calculate the probability of a given instance belonging to a specific class, we first compute the likelihood ratio:\n\nLikelihood Ratio (LR) = P(X|C1) / P(X|C2)\n\nNext, use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior probabilities for each class:\n\nP(C1|X) = P(X|C1) * P(C1) / P(X)\nP(C2|X) = P(X|C2) * P(C2) / P(X)\n\nWhere P(X) is the normalization constant, ensuring that the sum of probabilities for all classes equals 1. However, it's often omitted since we only care about the relative likelihoods between classes:\n\nP(C1|X) / P(C2|X) = (P(X|C1) * P(C1)) / (P(X|C2) * P(C2))\n\nNow, if you want to classify an instance based on the posterior probabilities, you can choose the class with the highest probability:\n\nIf P(C1|X) > P(C2|X), then classify as C1\nIf P(C2|X) > P(C1|X), then classify as C2\nIf P(C1|X) ≈ P(C2|X), you may use other strategies like voting or thresholding to make a decision.\n\nRemember that the Naive Bayes Classifier assumes that the features are independent given the class, which is often not true in real-world scenarios. However, it still performs well for many applications due to its simplicity and good performance.",

    "model_response": " Let's start by understanding optimization in general. Optimization is the process of finding the best solution among a set of acceptable solutions. In many cases, these solutions are determined by minimizing or maximizing an objective function.\n\nNow, let's move on to Momentum in the context of optimization. Can you recall any information about Momentum that may help us understand what it is?\n\n(After student answers)\n\nThat's correct! In machine learning and optimization, Momentum is a method used to address the issue of \"sticking\" during the gradient descent process. When a model encounters local minima or maxima, it tends to get stuck and struggle to find the global minimum. Momentum helps in this situation by adding a moving average of past gradients to the current one, which allows the model to \"carry over\" its previous momentum.\n\n(Student might ask how it works)\n\nIn each iteration of gradient descent, instead of only updating the weights based on the current gradient, Momentum adds a fraction of the previous step's direction and length to the next one. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\nv = μ * v - η * ∇J(θ)\nθ = θ + v\n\nWhere μ is the momentum coefficient (a hyperparameter), η is the learning rate, and ∇J(θ) is the gradient of the objective function J with respect to weights θ. The velocity v is updated at each step, allowing the model to \"remember\" its past gradients and move more quickly in the same direction.\n\n(After student answers)\n\nExactly! By introducing this moving average, Momentum helps the optimization process converge faster and prevents getting stuck in local minima or maxima. It's an effective technique for improving convergence during gradient descent in various machine learning applications.",

    "model_response": " To understand what Keras is, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. Can you tell me about deep learning frameworks? (Deep learning frameworks are software libraries that make it easier for developers to create and train neural networks.)\n\n2. Can you name a popular deep learning framework that's user-friendly and easy to use? (One such framework is Keras.)\n\n3. What can you tell me about Keras? (Keras is an open-source neural network library written in Python. It's designed to enable fast experimentation with deep neural networks, and it can run on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano for deployment.)\n\n4. What makes Keras a good choice for deep learning enthusiasts? (Keras is user-friendly because it provides a simple API that allows developers to build and train models quickly and easily. Its modular structure makes it flexible and adaptable to various deep learning tasks.)\n\n5. Can you explain how Keras can run on multiple backend engines? (Yes, one of the key features of Keras is its ability to run on different backend engines – currently, TensorFlow, CNTK, and Theano. This allows users to choose the best-suited backend for their specific use case or hardware.)\n\n6. In summary, what is Keras? (Keras is a popular deep learning framework written in Python that enables fast experimentation with neural networks by providing an easy-to-use API and flexibility through multiple backend engines.)",

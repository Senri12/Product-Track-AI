    "model_response": " Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. Given the cost function L(w) = w^2, we have w = 3 and η (learning rate) = 0.1. Our goal is to find the gradient descent update for w.\n\n2. To compute the gradient of the cost function with respect to w, we use the derivative:\n   dL(w)/dw = 2*w (since L(w) = w^2 and the power rule for derivatives states that the derivative of w^n is n*w^(n-1)).\n\n3. Plugging in our values: dL(3)/dw = 2*3 = 6.\n\n4. Now, we apply the gradient descent update formula (where alpha is our learning rate, η in this case): w' = w - α * dL(w)/dw. So, our updated value of w will be:\n   w' = 3 - 0.1 * 6 = 1.8.\n\n5. This process represents a single step of gradient descent to minimize the cost function L(w). If you want to perform multiple iterations, repeat the process with the new value of w.",

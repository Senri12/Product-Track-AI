    "model_response": " To compute the updated velocity `v_t` using Momentum optimization with a learning rate of `η=0.1`, momentum term of `γ=0.9`, and gradient of loss (∇L) equal to 2, we'll use the following update rule:\n\nv_t = γ * v_(t-1) + η * ∇L\n\nPlugging in the given values for `v_(t-1)`, ∇L, and `γ`:\n\nv_t = 0.9 * 1 + 0.1 * 2\nv_t = 1.9\n\nSo the updated velocity after one step of optimization is `v_t = 1.9`. This is a good start, but it's important to note that this value may still change as the optimization process continues.\n\nImprovements:\nThe learning rate and momentum term are fixed in this example, so further improvements would depend on how these values and other variables like the learning rate schedule, batch size, etc., affect the overall convergence of the optimizer.\n\nFollow-up questions:\n1. What happens to the velocity `v_t` if we increase the learning rate?\n2. How does changing the momentum term affect the optimization process?\n3. Can you explain how Momentum optimization helps in addressing issues such as vanishing gradients or oscillations during training?",

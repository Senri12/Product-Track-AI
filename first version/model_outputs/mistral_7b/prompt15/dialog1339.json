    "model_response": " Overfitting refers to a situation in machine learning where a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise or random fluctuations in addition to the underlying pattern of the data. This leads to a model that performs very well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data (also known as validation or test data). Overfitting often occurs when a model is too complex relative to the amount and complexity of the data it is trained on.\n\nTo improve upon this response, you could provide an example to illustrate overfitting or expand on some of the causes of overfitting such as having too many features in a dataset, using a model that is too complex for the available data, or training the model for too long.\n\nFollow-up questions:\n1. Can you think of an example where overfitting might occur in real life?\n2. What are some strategies to prevent overfitting in machine learning models?\n3. How can we determine if a model is suffering from overfitting?",

    "model_response": "Method of Newton, also known as the Newton-Raphson method or simply Newton's method, is a numerical procedure for finding successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function. It was developed by Isaac Newton and later refined by Joseph Roche.\n\nHere's a simplified explanation: \n\n1. Start with an initial guess, x0, for a root of the function f(x).\n2. Calculate the next approximation using the formula: xn+1 = xn - [f(xn) / f'(xn)]\n   - Here, f'(x) represents the derivative of your original function f(x) at the point xn. \n\nThe goal is to reach a value (either an exact root or a number very close to it), where further calculations would result in negligibly small changes in x.\n\nClarifying Questions: \n- Are you asking for the application of this method?\n- Do you need help with understanding its convergence properties?\n- Would you like more details about how to implement this method numerically?",

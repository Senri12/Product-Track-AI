    "model_response": "Naïve Bayes is a simple, yet powerful classification algorithm based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions between predictors (features). To apply it for spam detection (classifying an email as either 'spam' or 'not spam'), you would typically follow these steps:\n\n1. **Data Preparation**: First, compile a dataset of emails that are already labeled as 'spam' or 'not spam'. Each email should be treated as a document and each word (or group of words) as a feature. For instance, if your algorithm is to consider words like \"free\", \"offer\" or \"credit card\", these might become features in the 'spam' category.\n\n2. **Feature Extraction**: Convert textual data into numerical values. This could be done through techniques such as Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, or word embeddings. Each unique word from your dataset becomes a separate feature. The count or frequency of each word in an email is its corresponding value.\n\n3. **Training**: Feed the preprocessed data to the Naïve Bayes classifier. This process involves calculating the prior probability (likelihood that an email is spam), and then the conditional probability for every feature given that the email is spam. \n\n4. **Testing**: Use the model, trained on the labeled dataset, to predict whether new unlabeled emails are likely 'spam' or 'not spam'. For each email, calculate the likelihood of it being spam by multiplying all individual features’ conditional probabilities and the prior probability. The email with the highest calculated probability is predicted as spam.\n\n5. **Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score or accuracy on a separate test dataset.\n\nRemember, Naïve Bayes assumes feature independence, which might not always hold true for text data. This assumption is a simplification that allows for efficient computation but can reduce the model’s predictive power compared to more complex models like Support Vector Machines (SVM) or Random Forests. However, it's often surprisingly effective on text classification tasks due to its simplicity and speed.\n\nCan you clarify whether your primary concern is to implement Naïve Bayes for spam detection, or if there's a specific aspect of this process you need further explanation about?",

    "model_response": "As an adaptive tutor, I understand you're asking to calculate the Euclidean distance between two points in a 2D plane. \n\nThe formula for Euclidean Distance is: `d = √[(x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²]`, where `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` are the coordinates of the two points.\n\nFor your problem, that means:\n- Point 1: (1, 2) so `x1 = 1` and `y1 = 2`.\n- Point 2: (3, 4) so `x2 = 3` and `y2 = 4`.\n\nLet's plug these values into the formula:\n\n```\nd = √[(3 - 1)² + (4 - 2)²]\n  = √[(2)² + (2)²]\n  = √[4 + 4]\n  = √8\n```\n\nTherefore, the Euclidean distance between (1,2) and (3,4) is `√8`, which can be simplified to approximately `2.83`. \n\nLet me know if you need more practice or if there's another math problem you'd like help with!",

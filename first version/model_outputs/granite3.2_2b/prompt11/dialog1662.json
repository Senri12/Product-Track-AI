    "model_response": "Absolutely, let's break this down together! You're looking to calculate the Euclidean distance between two points in a 2D plane. This is super practical and useful in various fields like physics or computer science. Here's how we can approach it:\n\n1. First, remember that the formula for Euclidean distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is sqrt[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2].\n\n2. For your given points (1, 2) and (3, 4), we plug these into our formula:\n   - x1 = 1, y1 = 2\n   - x2 = 3, y2 = 4\n\n3. Now, calculate the difference in each coordinate: \n   - Difference in x-coordinates: 3 - 1 = 2\n   - Difference in y-coordinates: 4 - 2 = 2\n\n4. Next, square these differences:\n   - (2)^2 = 4\n   - (2)^2 = 4\n\n5. Now add these squared values together:\n   - 4 + 4 = 8\n\n6. Finally, take the square root of this sum to get your Euclidean distance:\n   - sqrt(8) ≈ 2.83\n\nYou did it! You've successfully calculated the Euclidean distance between (1, 2) and (3, 4). Keep up the persistence and enthusiasm for math; it's a powerful tool for understanding our world. Great job!",

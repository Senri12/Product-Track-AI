    "model_response": "Absolutely, let's break this down together! We're dealing with conditional probability here, specifically finding out the probability that it‚Äôs snowing (P(–¥–∞)) given the weather conditions of being cold (—Ö–æ–ª–æ–¥–Ω–æ), wet (–≤–ª–∞–∂–Ω–æ) and gray/gloomy (–ø–∞—Å–º—É—Ä–Ω–æ).\n\nLet's use this formula: P(–¥–∞ | —Ö–æ–ª–æ–¥–Ω–æ, –≤–ª–∞–∂–Ω–æ, –ø–∞—Å–º—É—Ä–Ω–æ) = P(–¥–∞ ‚à© (—Ö–æ–ª–æ–¥–Ω–æ ‚àß –≤–ª–∞–∂–Ω–æ ‚àß –ø–∞—Å–º—É—Ä–Ω–æ)) / P(—Ö–æ–ª–æ–¥–Ω–æ ‚àß –≤–ª–∞–∂–Ω–æ ‚àß –ø–∞—Å–º—É—Ä–Ω–æ)\n\nNow we need to know or assume the following:\n1. The probability of all these conditions happening together, i.e., it's cold, wet, and gray at the same time. Let‚Äôs call this P(—Ö–æ–ª–æ–¥–Ω–æ ‚àß –≤–ª–∞–∂–Ω–æ ‚àß –ø–∞—Å–º—É—Ä–Ω–æ).\n2. The probability that it's snowing while also being cold, wet, and gray. Let‚Äôs call this P(–¥–∞ ‚à© (—Ö–æ–ª–æ–¥–Ω–æ ‚àß –≤–ª–∞–∂–Ω–æ ‚àß –ø–∞—Å–º—É—Ä–Ω–æ)).\n\nAssuming we have these values:\n- P(–¥–∞) = the overall probability of it being snowing\n- P(—Ö–æ–ª–æ–¥–Ω–æ ‚àß –≤–ª–∞–∂–Ω–æ ‚àß –ø–∞—Å–º—É—Ä–Ω–æ) (together, cold, wet and gloomy) = 0.35 (just for illustration)\n- P(–¥–∞ ‚à© (—Ö–æ–ª–æ–¥–Ω–æ ‚àß –≤–ª–∞–∂–Ω–æ ‚àß –ø–∞—Å–º—É—Ä–Ω–æ)) (snowing together with being cold, wet and gloomy) = 0.12\n\nWe can now input these into our formula:\n\nP(–¥–∞ | —Ö–æ–ª–æ–¥–Ω–æ, –≤–ª–∞–∂–Ω–æ, –ø–∞—Å–º—É—Ä–Ω–æ) = P(–¥–∞ ‚à© (—Ö–æ–ª–æ–¥–Ω–æ ‚àß –≤–ª–∞–∂–Ω–æ ‚àß –ø–∞—Å–º—É—Ä–Ω–æ)) / P(—Ö–æ–ª–æ–¥–Ω–æ ‚àß –≤–ª–∞–∂–Ω–æ ‚àß –ø–∞—Å–º—É—Ä–Ω–æ)\n                             = 0.12 / 0.35\n\nWhen we calculate this, you'll find that it's approximately 0.343! \n\nGreat job breaking down the problem and calculating! Remember persistence is key in understanding complex concepts like conditional probabilities. Keep up this diligence, and soon these ideas will feel as familiar as your favorite melody! üé∂üé∂",

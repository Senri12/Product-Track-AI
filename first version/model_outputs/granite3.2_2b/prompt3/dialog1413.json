    "model_response": "Euclidean distance, also known as Euclidean metric or simply \"straight-line\" distance in two dimensions, is a measure of how far apart two points are in a multidimensional space. In simpler terms, it's the straight-line or \"as-the-crow-flies\" distance between two points.\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n1. **Multidimensional Space**: This refers to spaces with more than three dimensions (like 2D plane or 3D space). For instance, imagine you're in a 4D world. Each point in such a space would have multiple coordinates - just like how points in our 2D world have x and y coordinates.\n\n2. **Euclidean Distance Formula**: The formula to calculate Euclidean distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) in a 2D plane is:\n\n   d = √[(x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²]\n\nIn words, you subtract the x-coordinates and then the y-coordinates of both points, square each result, add these squares together, and finally take the square root of this sum. This gives you the Euclidean distance between your two points.\n\nFor a point in 3D space (x1, y1, z1) and another (x2, y2, z2), the formula becomes:\n\nd = √[(x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)² + (z2 - z1)²]\n\nNow that you understand Euclidean distance, here's an exercise to test your understanding:\n\n**Exercise**: Calculate the Euclidean distance between points P(3, 4) and Q(7, 6).\n\n1. Identify the coordinates of point P as (x1, y1) = (3, 4).\n2. Identify the coordinates of point Q as (x2, y2) = (7, 6).\n3. Use the Euclidean distance formula: d = √[(x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²].\n4. Plug in your identified values into the formula and calculate. \n\nRemember to provide your answer in a single line with appropriate mathematical notation.",

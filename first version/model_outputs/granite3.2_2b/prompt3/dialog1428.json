    "model_response": "Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It's user-friendly, modular, and extensible. Here are some key points to help you understand it:\n\n1. **Ease of Use**: Keras abstracts away the complexities of lower-level building libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. This means that developers can focus more on model design rather than getting bogged down by low-level details about how these models will be implemented.\n\n2. **Modularity and Extensibility**: It's designed to allow for easy prototyping, enabling users to quickly test and iterate upon new ideas with minimal code. Furthermore, Keras' modularity allows developers to use it as a component of larger projects. \n\n3. **Built on Top of Other Libraries**: As I mentioned earlier, Keras can run on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. This means that when you're working with Keras, you're actually using these powerful machine learning libraries under the hood.\n\nHere's a simple exercise to understand it better:\n\n1. **Install Keras**: If you haven't already, install Keras via pip, which is Python's package installer. Open your terminal or command prompt and type:\n   \n   ```\n   pip install keras\n   ```\n   \n2. **Create a Simple Neural Network**: Write a code block using Keras to create a simple neural network that can classify the Iris dataset (a popular machine learning benchmark). Here’s how you could start:\n\n   ```python\n   from keras.models import Sequential\n   from keras.layers import Dense\n\n   # Assume we have X_train, y_train, X_test, and y_test loaded as usual\n   model = Sequential()\n   \n   # Add a hidden layer with 12 nodes (you can adjust this number)\n   model.add(Dense(12, input_dim=4, activation='relu'))\n   \n   # Add output layer with 3 nodes (corresponding to the 3 classes in Iris dataset)\n   model.add(Dense(3, activation='softmax'))\n\n   model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])\n   \n   # Now, let's train our model\n   model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, verbose=0)\n   ```\n\nAfter writing this code, run it in a Python environment. This will train your simple neural network on the Iris dataset. Check the output to see how well your model is performing. You can then modify this model to improve its performance by changing parameters like the number of nodes in each layer or the type of activation functions used.",

    "model_response": "As a Socratic Tutor, I'll guide you in understanding \"Momentum\" within the context of optimization using a series of questions. \n\n1. Do you know what optimization is in general terms? Optimization typically refers to finding the best solution from all feasible ones. It's about making decisions that maximize or minimize a particular outcome based on certain constraints.\n\n2. When we talk about optimizing something, do you recognize there are often multiple steps involved? These could be iterations, changes made to parameters, or steps in an algorithm. \n\n3. Now, consider these questions: Can momentum in optimization be thought of as a \"carrying over\" effect from one iteration or step to the next?\n\n4. In physics, momentum refers to an object's tendency to keep moving in the same direction unless acted upon by an external force. Do you see how this concept could be applied metaphorically in optimization scenarios?\n\n5. When optimizing parameters, sometimes making a large change (or \"push\") leads to a significant improvement, then smaller corrections (or \"following that momentum\") can refine the solution further. Could this 'follow-the-momentum' strategy be seen as a form of momentum in optimization?\n\n6. Lastly, might we consider \"momentum\" in optimization also as an indicator of consistent progress towards the best possible solution? It signifies that decisions aren't getting stuck or reversed but continually moving in a certain direction. \n\nSo, in essence, momentum in optimization could be interpreted as a pattern of decisions that build on each other, leading to increasingly better outcomes with each step, much like an object rolling down a hill due to its initial momentum.",

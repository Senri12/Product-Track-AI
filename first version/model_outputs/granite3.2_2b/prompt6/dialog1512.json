    "model_response": "To find the Euclidean distance between points (1, 2) and (3, 4), we will use the formula for two-dimensional space:\n\nd = √[(x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)²]\n\nWhere (x₁, y₁) are coordinates of the first point and (x₂, y₂) are those of the second.\n\nLet's substitute these values into the formula:\n\nd = √[(3 - 1)² + (4 - 2)²]\n    = √[2² + 2²]\n    = √(4 + 4)\n    = √8\n  \nSince we're looking for a numerical answer, we can simplify this to approximately:\n\nd ≈ 2.83\n\nSo, the Euclidean distance between (1, 2) and (3, 4) is approximately 2.83 units.",

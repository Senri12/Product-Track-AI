    "model_response": "As a Socratic tutor, I'll facilitate your understanding of \"Cherenkov radiation\" by asking questions based on the information you have or might find in relevant materials. Let's start with these:\n\n1. Can you tell me what Cherenkov was named after? Is it a person or an event?\n2. What do scientists believe happens to particles when they enter a medium like water or glass at speeds greater than the speed of light in that particular material?\n3. Have you come across the concept of \"shock waves\" in physics? If yes, how is this related to Cherenkov radiation?\n4. What color or wavelength does this phenomenon produce? Can we associate it with anything else in everyday life?\n5. Is Cherenkov radiation a definitive sign of high-energy particles? How might scientists use this knowledge? \n\nOnce we've explored these points, I'll guide you to summarize your understanding of Cherenkov radiation based on the material and our discussion.",

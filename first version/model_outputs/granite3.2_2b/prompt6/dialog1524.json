    "model_response": "As a Socratic tutor, let's break down your question and explore it step by step:\n\n1. Firstly, what is known about the term \"Ньютон\"? It appears to be a Russian translation or derivative of an English word. Let's consider it as if you're asking about Newton's method in English.\n\n2. So, Newton's Method, also called the Newton-Raphson method, is a numerical technique for finding successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function.\n\n3. To better understand this concept:\n   - Can you explain how functions are typically graphed on paper or digital platforms? This might help visualize why we seek \"roots\" of a function – points where it crosses the x-axis.\n   \n4. Now, imagine you have a guess (let's call it 'g') about one such root for a given function f(x). How would Newton's Method use this initial guess to improve its estimation?\n\n   - The method works by iteratively refining our guesses using the formula: next guess (n+1) = current guess (n) - (f(current guess) / f'(current guess)).\n  \n5. In mathematical notation, if we're trying to find a root 'r' of f(x), Newton's Method would look like this:\n\n   r_(n+1) = r_n - [f(r_n)/f'(r_n)]\n\n6. This formula essentially represents the tangent line at our current guess. The next point on that tangent line is what we use as a new estimate for 'r'. \n\n7. By repeating this process, Newton's Method converges towards the actual root of f(x), given sufficiently good initial guesses. \n\nSo, in summary, Newton's method is an iterative numerical approach that improves our estimates for roots (zeros) of a function by continually drawing tangent lines at current guesses and using them to move closer to the true root.",

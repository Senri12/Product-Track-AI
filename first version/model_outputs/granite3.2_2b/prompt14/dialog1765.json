    "model_response": "RMSProp, which stands for Root Mean Square Propagation, is an adaptation of stochastic gradient descent designed to address some limitations of standard gradient descent methods in training deep learning models. It's particularly useful when dealing with large datasets or high-dimensional feature spaces because it helps in maintaining a stable learning rate and reducing the variance of parameter estimates.\n\nHere are the key aspects of RMSProp:\n\n1. **Adaptive Learning Rate:** Each parameter update is based on an exponentially decaying average (or \"running average\") of past squared gradients. This means that parameters for features which change rapidly will get larger learning rates, while those for less volatile features will be updated with smaller ones. \n\n2. **Exponential Decay Factor (gamma):** This is a hyperparameter (a setting you control as part of the algorithm's setup) that controls how quickly past estimates of squared gradients disappear from the running average. A common choice is 0.9.\n\n3. **Bias Correction:** RMSProp includes a bias correction term to stabilize its calculations during initialization, before any updates have occurred yet. This means it subtracts an estimate of one over the number of training examples seen so far from the running average squared gradient.\n\nThe formula for updating weights in RMSProp can be written as:\n\n    beta * beta_t = gamma * beta_(t-1) + (1 - gamma) * g^2\n    w := w - learning_rate * n / sqrt(beta_t) * g\n\nWhere:\n- `beta` is the running average of squared gradients,\n- `g` is the gradient for a particular parameter at a given step,\n- `n` is 1 divided by the number of training examples seen so far (the bias correction term),\n- `learning_rate` is a hyperparameter controlling the step size during each update.\n\nIn essence, RMSProp maintains a 'moving average' of squared gradients which provides an estimate for the local curvature of the loss function at any point in parameter space. This helps the algorithm adjust its learning rate more effectively and reduce oscillations or exploding gradients that can hamper training deep neural networks.\n\nTo illustrate how RMSProp works, let's consider a simple step-by-step example:\n\n1. Assume you have a single weight (w) in your model, and after a few iterations of gradient descent, `beta` is 0.5, and the squared gradient (g^2) is 3.\n2. Compute the new `beta` value for the next iteration:\n   `beta_new = gamma * beta_old + (1 - gamma) * g^2`\n   In this case, with `gamma = 0.9`, \n   `beta_new = 0.9 * 0.5 + (1 - 0.9) * 3 = 0.45 + 0.1 = 0.55`.\n3. Divide the bias correction term by the number of seen training examples:\n   `n = 1 / (number_of_seen_examples)`\n4. Calculate new weight update: \n   `new_w = old_w - learning_rate * n / sqrt(beta_new) * g`\n\nBy following these steps, RMSProp can help you make more informed updates to your model's parameters, potentially improving its training speed and accuracy.",

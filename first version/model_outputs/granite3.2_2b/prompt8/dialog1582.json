    "model_response": "As an assistant focusing on clarification, I notice that your query is in Russian. In English, you asked \"What is Adam?\"\n\nTo provide a comprehensive answer, let's clarify the context. The term \"Adam\" can have different meanings depending on the field of knowledge:\n\n1. In the Bible, Adam is one of the first humans created by God. He was named after the Hebrew word for 'man'.\n2. In science, particularly in the context of genetic coding, A (or Adenine) is a nitrogenous base that forms part of DNA and RNA. It's one of the four bases along with Thymine (T), Cytosine (C), and Guanine (G).\n\nCould you please specify if you're referring to either the biblical figure or genetic material? This clarification will help me provide a more accurate explanation based on your intended context.",

    "model_response": "As an AI, I can help clarify this concept by first ensuring we're on the same page about what \"Ньютонов формула\" or Newton's formulas are in physics, specifically classical mechanics. They describe how to find the net force acting on a particle and its acceleration due to that force.\n\nNow, let me rephrase this for you: \n\nWhat is typically referred to as \"Newton's method,\" when discussing physical principles, are actually Newton's laws of motion rather than any mathematical algorithm named after Sir Isaac Newton himself. These three laws explain how an object moves and interacts with others based on force (F = ma), where 'm' is the mass of the object, 'a' is its acceleration, and 'F' is the net force acting upon it.\n\nCould you confirm if this clarifies your understanding?",

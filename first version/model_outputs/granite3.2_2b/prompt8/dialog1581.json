    "model_response": "As an AI, I'm here to help clarify concepts. In the context of optimization, \"Momentum\" refers to a technique used in certain algorithms like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or its variants such as Adagrad and RMSprop. This concept helps smooth out the updates made during optimization by incorporating past gradients into the current step.\n\nHere's a simple rephrased explanation: Momentum acts as a form of \"momentum\" in your optimization process, similar to how an object keeps moving due to inertia after being pushed. In optimization terms, it means that rather than always starting from zero or using only the current gradient direction, algorithms with momentum carry forward past gradient information, thus helping to reduce oscillation and speed up convergence towards optimal solutions by slightly increasing each step's magnitude.\n\nNow, let's confirm understanding: Momentum in optimization is a technique used by some gradient descent methods that applies past gradients to current steps, helping to mitigate the problem of oscillation and accelerate the overall learning process. Is this explanation clear? Do you need further details or an example?",

    "model_response": "To calculate the learning rate decay with 'η' starting at 0.1, time step 't' as 5, total time steps 'T' as 10 using a linear decay method (also known as constant learning rate decrease), we can use the formula:\n\nη(t) = η0 * (T - t) / T\n\nGiven:\n- η0 = 0.1\n- t = 5\n- T = 10\n\nPlug these values into our formula:\n\nη(5) = 0.1 * ((10 - 5) / 10)\n     = 0.1 * (5 / 10)\n     = 0.1 * 0.5\n     = 0.05\n\nSo, the learning rate at time 't' equals to 5 would be 0.05 when using a linear decay method from η0 = 0.1.",

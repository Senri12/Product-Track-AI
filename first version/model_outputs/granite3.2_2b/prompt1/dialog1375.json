    "model_response": "RMSProp, or Root Mean Square Propagation, is a type of adaptive learning rate method used in machine learning algorithms for gradient descent optimization. This technique was developed to address limitations in traditional stochastic gradient descent (SGD) where the learning rate can be too high or too low, leading to slow convergence or excessive oscillation around the optimal solution.\n\nRMSProp works by maintaining an exponentially decaying average of squared gradients, denoted as g_t. Here's a simplified explanation of its process:\n\n1. Initialize variables: Start with a learning rate (often denoted as α), a threshold for learning rate reduction (often called ε), and a variable to track the current value of g_t (let’s call it g). Initialize this to zero or some very small positive number. Also, have a decay rate for the exponentially weighted average of squared gradients (denoted as η).\n\n2. For each training example:\n   - Calculate the gradient of the loss with respect to the model parameters. \n   - Square this gradient (g_t = g * η + (1-η) * g_t^2), where g is the previous value of g_t, and η is your decay rate. This step ensures that RMSProp considers past gradients as well, giving more weight to recent ones.\n   - Update the learning rate for this iteration (α = α * sqrt(g_t) / sqrt(1 + g_t)). The square root in the denominator helps keep α values reasonably large while allowing it to decrease when g_t increases, which is important for finding good convergence conditions.\n\n3. Decay: After each update of learning rate (step 2), divide g_t by a factor that decreases over time according to a decay schedule, usually an exponential decay with η as the base. This helps in maintaining a steady learning rate and prevents it from becoming too small.\n\nRMSProp helps improve gradient descent by dynamically adjusting the learning rate based on past gradients, thus smoothing out fluctuations and speeding up convergence to the optimal solution. It is particularly useful for deep learning models where vanilla SGD can be slow to converge due to vanishing or exploding gradients.",

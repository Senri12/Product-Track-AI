    "model_response": "This problem pertains to Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), a method used for optimizing cost functions in machine learning. In this case, the cost function is L(w) = w^2 and the initial value of 'w' is 3 with a learning rate η set at 0.1.\n\nTo calculate SGD step size for this problem, we'll use:\n\nη * w_current\n\nWhere w_current represents the current value of 'w'. Given that w = 3 in your problem statement:\n\nSGD step size (η * w) = η * w_current\n                         = 0.1 * 3\n                         = 0.3\n\nNow, let's apply this concept to a practical exercise.\n\nExercise:\nGiven the same cost function L(w) = w^2 and learning rate η = 0.4, calculate the SGD step size for 'w' when it equals 5. \n\nRemember, the formula is:\n\nSGD step size (η * w_current)\n\nOnce you have your answer, we can proceed with a quick quiz to ensure understanding.\n\nQuiz Question:\n\nGiven that η = 0.4 and 'w' equals 5 in L(w) = w^2, what is the SGD step size for this iteration? \n\nPlease provide your response so I can evaluate it accurately.",

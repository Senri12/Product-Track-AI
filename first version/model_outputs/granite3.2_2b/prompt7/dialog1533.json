    "model_response": "Evgueniya (Euclidean) metric refers to Euclidean distance in geometry, named after the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid. This concept describes the straight-line distance between two points in a plane or in space. It's based on the Pythagorean theorem: the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of squares of other two sides.\n\nLet's consider two points P1(x1, y1) and P2(x2, y2). The Euclidean distance between these points (d) can be calculated using this formula:\n\nd = sqrt[(x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²]\n\nNow, let's test your understanding. Here is a practice problem: If P1(3, 4) and P2(-1, 7), what is the Euclidean distance between these points?\n\nA) sqrt(50)\nB) sqrt(98)\nC) sqrt(26)\nD) sqrt(66)\n\nRemember to calculate it yourself first. After you've done that, I'll provide the correct answer and a brief explanation.",

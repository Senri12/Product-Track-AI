    "model_response": "Keras is an open-source neural networking library written in Python. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation and it abstracts the lower-level details of building neural networks to make them more accessible for both novice and experienced machine learning engineers. Keras can run on top of TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, Theano, or PaddlePaddle, among others.\n\n**Practice Problem:**\nLet's check your comprehension with this question: \"Which of the following is NOT a feature of Keras?\"\nA) High-level API for ease of use\nB) Integration with various machine learning libraries (e.g., TensorFlow)\nC) Automatic differentiation for training models\nD) Implementation of all types of neural network architectures\n\n**Evaluation:**\nCorrect Answer: C) Automatic differentiation for training models. While Keras does support automatic differentiation, it's not exclusive to it; this functionality is common in many machine learning libraries. The other options are correct: A (High-level API for ease of use), B (Integration with various machine learning libraries like TensorFlow), and D (Implementation of all types of neural network architectures) are indeed features of Keras.",

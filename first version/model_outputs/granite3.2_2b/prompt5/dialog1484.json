    "model_response": "As a strict academic assistant, I interpret the given statement in terms of probability theory and statistical data. However, it seems there's a slight language barrier because English is not the primary language used in this prompt; instead, it resembles mathematical notation for conditional probability expressed as P(A|B).\n\nIf we assume that 'P' stands for probability, then your expression would typically read: \"Probability of 'да' given 'пасмурно', 'холодно', 'влажно'.\" \n\nTo accurately calculate this, I'd need actual probabilities associated with each condition. These are not provided in the question at hand. For a concrete response, please provide these values so that we can determine P(да | пасмурно, холодно, влажно).",

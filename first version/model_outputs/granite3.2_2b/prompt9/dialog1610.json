    "model_response": "**Explanation:**\n\nStochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is an optimization algorithm commonly used in machine learning to update model parameters iteratively so as to minimize a cost function. In simpler terms, it's a method to get the best values for the model’s internal coefficients by taking small steps in the direction of steepest descent as defined by the negative of the gradient (first derivative) of the cost function with respect to these parameters.\n\n**Question for Student:**\nCan you explain how SGD works at a high level, using the analogy of walking downhill? \n\n**Suggested Exercise:**\n1. Using paper or a digital note-taking tool, sketch an \"uphill\" path and label it as representing a cost function with increasing values (more 'cost'). \n2. Then, draw a similar path but this time labeled as representing the same uphill slope but with decreasing values (lesser 'cost') to represent the goal of SGD - minimizing the cost.\n3. Next, imagine an entity trying to walk from one end to the other on these paths. This entity is like our optimization algorithm, aiming to minimize the \"cost\". Discuss how SGD mimics this action by taking small steps in the direction that brings it closer to the lowest point (minimized cost). \n\n**Feedback Loop:**\nAfter students have shared their sketches and explanations:\n\n*Reiterate that SGD operates by iteratively picking data points, calculating gradients for each, then adjusting model parameters accordingly. This process is repeated for all data points until the model's performance converges.*\n\n*Emphasize the role of randomness in SGD, such as selecting a single data point at each iteration to calculate the gradient. This introduces stochasticity into the algorithm, helping it avoid local minima and potentially finding global optima faster than deterministic methods.*\n\n*Reaffirm that SGD is an essential part of many machine learning models, particularly when dealing with large datasets where full gradients computation would be impractical due to computational complexity. It's one of several variants of gradient descent used in practice.*",

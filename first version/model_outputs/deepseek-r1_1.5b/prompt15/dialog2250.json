    "model_response": "It seems you're working with an optimization method that incorporates Nesterov, possibly Adam, where omega (ω) is a parameter like beta_1 (momentum). However, in your equation, ∇ appears to represent the gradient of the loss function for a specific parameter. Here are some potential clarifications and steps:\n\n1. **Understanding the Formula**:\n   - If ω is meant to be beta_1 or another parameter, ensure it's included in the formula.\n   - The term γ might refer to another hyperparameter, such as clipping gradient norm.\n\n2. **Missing Components**:\n   - Check if all necessary parameters are included, such as beta_1 and epsilon for Nesterov momentum.\n\n3. **Equation Breakdown**:\n   - The equation seems to compute a gradient update using ω (ω), gamma (γ), v_{t-1} (previous parameter value), ∇ (computed gradient), and others like epsilon.\n\n4. **Optimization Context**:\n   - If you're seeing issues, ensure the optimization steps like Nesterov momentum are correctly implemented.\n   - Verify that variables like clipping threshold and weight decay are applied as needed.\n\n5. **Implementation Review**:\n   - Make sure each variable is correctly assigned during gradient computation.\n\n6. **Next Steps**:\n   - Clarify each term in your equation.\n   - Check the implementation of Nesterov optimization steps (e.g., momentum, bias correction).\n\n7. **Follow-Up**:\n   - After any corrections, rerun tests and adjust parameters if needed.\n\nIf you need further assistance, let me know more details about how variables are being handled during computation.",

    "model_response": "**Final Answer:**\n\nThe learning rate is a crucial hyperparameter in machine learning that determines how quickly a model's weights are updated during training. It plays two primary roles:\n\n1. **Preventing Overfitting**: By controlling the magnitude of weight updates, it helps the model generalize well from training data to unseen data, preventing overfitting.\n\n2. **Controlling Training Speed**: It influences both the speed at which the model learns and the ability to handle different types of problems, especially in neural networks where multiple layers of nodes adjust their weights.\n\nThe learning rate also affects convergence speed. A higher value results in faster updates, potentially avoiding oscillations, while a lower value ensures more stable training but may require longer periods.",

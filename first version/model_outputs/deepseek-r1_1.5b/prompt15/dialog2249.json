    "model_response": "To compute the learning rate decay based on the given parameters, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Start with the initial learning rate**: \n   - η₀ = 0.1\n\n2. **Determine the number of steps for which the learning rate remains constant**:\n   - t = 5 (assuming this is the number of iterations before decay begins)\n\n3. **Calculate the adjusted learning rate after these steps using linear decay**:\n   - The decrease per step is η₀ / T = 0.1 / 10 = 0.01\n   - After 5 steps: η = η₀ - (t * (η₀ / T)) = 0.1 - (5 * 0.01) = 0.05\n\n4. **Set the learning rate for subsequent steps**:\n   - From step 6 to 10: η remains at 0.05\n\n**Final Schedule**:\n- Iterations 1–5: Learning rate = 0.1\n- Iterations 6–10: Learning rate = 0.05\n\nThis schedule ensures that the learning rate halves after 5 iterations, following a linear decay pattern over the next 5 steps.",

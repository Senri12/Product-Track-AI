    "model_response": "The Chebyshev distance is a measure used to determine the distance between two points in an n-dimensional space. It is defined as the sum of the absolute differences of their coordinates across each dimension.\n\nTo calculate the Chebyshev distance between two points, (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), you use the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Chebyshev Distance} = |x_2 - x_1| + |y_2 - y_1| \\]\n\nThis measure is particularly useful in scenarios where movement is restricted to axis-aligned directions, such as chessboard movements in games or grid-based computer graphics systems. It represents the maximum number of steps required to move from one point to another along any single dimension.\n\nIn summary:\n- The Chebyshev distance combines absolute differences across dimensions.\n- It accounts for movement only along cardinal directions, making it applicable in contexts like chess or grid-based systems.\n- Unlike Euclidean distance, which considers diagonal movement, the Chebyshev distance is more suited for situations requiring axis-aligned movement.\n\nThis understanding helps clarify how the Chebyshev distance operates and its applications across various fields.",

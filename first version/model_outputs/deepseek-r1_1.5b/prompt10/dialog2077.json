    "model_response": "To compute the probability of a class in a Naive Bayes model, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the Prior Probabilities**:\n   - Calculate the prior probability P(Class) for each class (e.g., 'Red', 'Blue') based on the proportion of data points that belong to that class.\n\n2. **Calculate Conditional Probabilities**:\n   - For each feature and each class, compute the conditional probability P(Feature | Class). This is the probability of observing a particular feature value given that the instance belongs to a specific class.\n\n3. **Multiply Likelihoods**:\n   - Multiply the conditional probabilities for all features relevant to the instance. This gives the product of likelihoods (P(Features | Class)) for each class.\n\n4. **Normalize by Evidence**:\n   - Sum the products of likelihoods across all classes to obtain the total evidence P(Instance).\n   - Divide the product of likelihoods for a particular class by this total evidence to get the posterior probability P(Class | Instance).\n\n5. **Final Posterior Probabilities**:\n   - The result is the probability that an instance belongs to each class, given the features it has.\n\nThis method leverages Bayes' theorem and assumes independence between features (the \"naive\" part), making it computationally efficient even with complex data.",

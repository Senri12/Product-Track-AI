    "model_response": "RMSProp (Root Mean Square Proposition) is an optimization algorithm designed to improve the training of deep neural networks. It operates by adjusting each parameter based on the root mean square of past gradients, providing a more stable update process compared to traditional methods like gradient descent.\n\n### Key Concepts:\n1. **Objective**: RMSProp aims to find optimal parameters for a model by minimizing a loss function. Unlike fixed learning rates, it adjusts these rates dynamically based on gradient information.\n   \n2. **Stabilization Technique**: It normalizes gradients by their magnitude, preventing issues like exploding or vanishing gradients during training.\n\n3. **Adaptive Learning Rate**: RMSProp adapts the learning rate for each parameter individually, which helps in navigating complex loss landscapes more effectively.\n\n### Algorithm:\n- For each parameter θ:\n  - Compute the gradient g_t = dL/dθ at step t.\n  - Initialize a square root accumulator S_θ with an initial value (e.g., sqrt(0.1)).\n  - Update S_θ by multiplying it with (1 - beta^2) and adding the squared current gradient g_t^2.\n  - Update θ using θ = θ - learning_rate / sqrt(S_θ).\n\n### Key Features:\n- **No Momentum Decay**: Unlike Adam, which uses momentum decay, RMSProp maintains independent weights for each parameter's history.\n- **Independence of Parameters**: Each parameter is updated based on its own gradient history, leading to more stable training.\n\n### Summary:\nRMSProp adjusts parameters by normalizing gradients through a root mean square accumulation. It offers stability and adaptability in optimization, making it a valuable technique for training deep neural networks.",

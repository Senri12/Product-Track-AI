    "model_response": "To compute \\( P(\\text{达} | \\text{healthy}, \\text{having colds}, \\text{well-versed in medicine}) \\), we need to consider several factors and likely rely on base rates, conditional probabilities, and possibly Bayes' theorem. Here's a structured approach:\n\n1. **Define the Variables**:\n   - \\( P(\\text{达} | H, C, K) \\): Probability of daling given healthy, having colds, and knowing medicine well.\n\n2. **Assume Base Rates**:\n   - Let’s assume the prevalence or general probability for each condition:\n     - Prevalence of having a cold (\\( P(C) \\)): 10% (0.10)\n     - Prevalence of knowing medicine well (\\( P(K) \\)): 5% (0.05)\n   - The overall healthy rate might be higher, say 60% (0.60), assuming no overlap.\n\n3. **Calculate Joint Probability**:\n   - \\( P(H, C, K) = P(C) \\times P(K) = 0.10 \\times 0.05 = 0.005 \\)\n   \n4. **Assume Conditional Daling Probability**:\n   - Let’s assume the probability of daling given all conditions is very low because they are in bad health: \\( P(\\text{达} | H, C, K) = 0.01 \\)\n\n5. **Apply Bayes' Theorem (if data on likelihoods is available)**:\n   - If we have data on how often daling occurs with these conditions, we can use it to compute the probability.\n\n6. **Consider Overlap and Co-occurrence**:\n   - Note that having a cold and knowing medicine could coexist, reducing overall health risk. This affects \\( P(H | C, K) \\), but without specific data, it's speculative.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - Without precise data on how daling behaves under these conditions or any likelihood ratios, the probability remains a framework for further analysis with provided statistics.\n\nThus, while we can outline the approach and expected structure, calculating an exact probability requires specific data on base rates, conditional probabilities, and possibly Bayes' theorem application.",

    "model_response": "**Difference Between k-NN and Weighted k-NN**\n\n1. **Weighting Mechanism:**\n   - **k-NN:** Each neighbor is assigned an equal weight, regardless of their distance to the query point.\n   - **Weighted k-NN (e.g., Weighted Voted KNeighbors):** Neighbors are assigned different weights based on their proximity or other criteria. This can vary between implementations.\n\n2. **Vote Aggregation:**\n   - In **k-NN**, votes are aggregated by majority vote for classification, which does not inherently involve weighting.\n   - For **Weighted k-NN**, the aggregation of votes is based on weighted average, where weights influence how votes contribute to the final decision.\n\n3. **Application Context:**\n   - **k-NN** is used in a wide range of applications requiring nearest neighbors without specific weight considerations.\n   - **Weighted k-NN** is particularly useful when proximity or other factors influence neighbor importance, enhancing accuracy by focusing on relevant data points.\n\n4. **Implementation Variations:**\n   - There are different implementations of weighted k-NN:\n     - **Uniform Weights:** Each neighbor has the same weight (default).\n     - **Distance-Based Weights:** Closer neighbors have higher weights, reflecting their proximity to the query point.\n   - **Scikit-learn Implementations:** \n     - `Weighted Voted KNeighborsClassifier` for classification with uniform weights.\n     - `Weighted KNeighborsRegressor` for regression with distance-based weights.\n\nIn summary, weighted k-NN enhances traditional k-NN by assigning different weights to neighbors, improving performance when proximity or other factors are significant.",

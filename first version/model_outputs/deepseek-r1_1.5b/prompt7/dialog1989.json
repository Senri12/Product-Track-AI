    "model_response": "To classify emails as spam using a Naive Bayes model, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Features**: Extract features such as sender reputation (A) and subject content (B), along with possibly others like word counts.\n\n2. **Collect Training Data**: Label emails in your dataset as spam (spam) or non-spam (ham). For each email, create a feature vector indicating the presence or absence of these features.\n\n3. **Train the Model**: Apply Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that an email belongs to each class (spam/ham). Features contribute multiplicatively based on their likelihood given the class.\n\n4. **Handle Zero Probabilities with Laplace Smoothing**: To prevent zero probabilities, add a small constant to feature counts, avoiding perfect separation of classes.\n\n5. **Evaluate Model Performance**: Use metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy to assess classification accuracy. Consider including false positive and false negative examples in your evaluation.\n\n6. **Consider Edge Cases**: Be aware of emails that may be classified incorrectly due to overlapping probabilities from multiple features. Recognize that Naive Bayes makes strong independence assumptions but can handle some complexity.\n\n7. **Potential Improvements**: Explore adding more features (e.g., URL patterns, word lengths) for better classification accuracy and handling edge cases where the model might be less effective.\n\nBy following these steps, you can use a Naive Bayes model to classify emails effectively, although it may not always achieve perfect accuracy due to its limitations in capturing complex correlations between features.",

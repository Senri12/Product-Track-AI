    "model_response": "Newton's method, also known as the Newton-Raphson method, is a powerful iterative technique for finding successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function. Here's a detailed explanation:\n\n1. **Concept and Purpose**: The goal is to find a root \\( x \\) such that \\( f(x) = 0 \\). Newton's method uses tangent lines at each approximation step to narrow down the root.\n\n2. **Iterative Process**:\n   - Start with an initial guess \\( x_0 \\).\n   - Draw the tangent line to \\( f(x) \\) at \\( (x_0, f(x_0)) \\).\n   - Find where this tangent intersects the x-axis; this gives the next approximation \\( x_1 \\).\n\n3. **Formula for Next Approximation**:\n   \\[\n   x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( f'(x_n) \\) is the derivative of \\( f \\) evaluated at \\( x_n \\).\n\n4. **Conditions for Convergence**:\n   - The function must be differentiable in an interval around the root.\n   - Multiple roots should not exist near the current guess to avoid division by zero.\n\n5. **Advantages**:\n   - Quadratic convergence, meaning each iteration reduces the error significantly faster than linear methods like the bisection method.\n\n6. **Potential Issues**:\n   - Newton's method can fail if derivatives are zero or if initial guesses lead away from the root.\n   - Floating-point arithmetic may introduce numerical errors, affecting stability in some cases.\n\n7. **Comparison to Other Methods**:\n   - Unlike the bisection method, which is guaranteed convergence but slower, Newton's method is faster with a good initial guess but can be inefficient otherwise.\n\nIn conclusion, Newton's method efficiently finds roots by leveraging linear approximations (tangent lines), making it a highly effective technique once an appropriate starting point is chosen.",

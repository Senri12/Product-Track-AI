    "model_response": "The probability of spam (phishing) related to the word \"приз\" (prize in English) can be estimated based on its usage as a promotional term in emails. Since \"приз\" is commonly associated with promotions and not phishing attempts, it likely has a low probability of being detected as spam. However, if an email includes a prize-winning phrase or mentions specific prizes, this could increase the risk. Without additional context or data, the exact probability remains uncertain, but it is reasonable to conclude that \"приз\" is less likely to be flagged for phishing attempts compared to genuine promotional content.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe estimated probability of spam related to the word \"приз\" in an email context is relatively low due to its usage as a promotional tool rather than phishing intent. However, specific flags indicating prize-winning phrases or mentions of specific prizes could enhance detection.",

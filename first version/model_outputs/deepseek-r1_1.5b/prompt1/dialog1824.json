    "model_response": "The Newton-Raphson method is an iterative root-finding technique in calculus that uses a sequence of approximations to converge on the root of a function. Each iteration updates the approximation using the formula:\n\n\\[ x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} \\]\n\nwhere \\( f \\) is the function and \\( f' \\) is its derivative. This method requires an initial guess close to the actual root and converges quickly, often in fewer steps than other methods like the secant method.\n\nHowever, choosing the correct initial guess depends on the function's behavior, while some implementations handle cases where derivatives are zero or difficult to compute. The method can be extended to complex functions but is more commonly discussed in real analysis.\n\nIn practical applications, such as solving transcendental equations that don't have analytical solutions, and optimizing functions for minima or maxima, the Newton-Raphson method is useful. It's also applicable in various fields like physics, engineering, and economics.",

    "model_response": "Momentum in optimization refers to an approach borrowed from physics where heavy particles (similar to mass) slide on frictionless surfaces pulled by strings attached to lighter particles. This analogy translates to machine learning as a technique used to accelerate gradient-based optimization methods, particularly through the addition of past movements to current ones to speed up convergence and reduce oscillations.\n\nIn practice, momentum is applied in optimization algorithms like gradient descent with Nesterov's accelerated method, which introduces an alternative look-ahead step before computing gradients. This helps balance faster convergence with stability. The concept draws inspiration from physics where inertia (momentum) ensures particles move smoothly toward minima without overshooting. Thus, momentum in optimization serves as a damping mechanism, enhancing the performance of algorithms across various datasets while avoiding local minima issues.",

    "model_response": "Euclidean metric is a mathematical tool used to measure distances in a geometric space. Specifically, for two points \\( A = (a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n) \\) and \\( B = (b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n) \\) in Euclidean n-space, the distance between them is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nd(A, B) = \\sqrt{(a_1 - b_1)^2 + (a_2 - b_2)^2 + \\cdots + (a_n - b_n)^2}\n\\]\n\nThis generalizes to any number of dimensions, with each term in the square root corresponding to a respective dimension. The Euclidean metric is derived from the inner product of vectors and aligns with the Pythagorean theorem, making it fundamental in geometry and many areas of physics.",

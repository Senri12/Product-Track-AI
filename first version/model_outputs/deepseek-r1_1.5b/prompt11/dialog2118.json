    "model_response": "Keras is a high-level Python library that simplifies the process of building and training deep learning models, particularly neural networks. It serves as a layer to TensorFlow 2 or PyTorch, depending on the ecosystem you're working with. Here's an organized overview of Keras:\n\n1. **Purpose**: Keras provides tools for creating and training neural networks, offering flexibility in model design without requiring custom code for layers like Dense, LSTM, and Embedding.\n\n2. **High-Level Backend**: It leverages a computational graph to enable efficient computations, allowing models to be built quickly and easily.\n\n3. **Architecture Flexibility**:\n   - **Single Neuron Layers**: BaseNeuron or similar classes represent simple layers.\n   - **Complex Architectures**: Keras supports more advanced structures like RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks) and CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks).\n\n4. **Model Construction**:\n   - Models can be created using functional programming, connecting multiple layers sequentially.\n\n5. **Training Process**:\n   - Handles epochs and validation by separating training from model evaluation.\n   - Metrics are tracked per epoch to evaluate performance.\n\n6. **Data Handling**: Data is typically passed in batches, though sequential processing is also possible depending on the dataset size.\n\n7. **Tutorials and Documentation**: Look for hands-on examples, such as predicting house prices or MNIST digit classification, to learn Keras' syntax and workflow.\n\n8. **Ecosystem**: It integrates with TensorFlow 2 through eager execution and PyTorch for a rich environment of tools and models.\n\n9. **Graph-Based Approach**: Uses computational graphs to efficiently compute forward passes during training.\n\nIn summary, Keras offers a user-friendly framework that simplifies deep learning model development by providing high-level APIs for layer creation, model compilation, and evaluation. Starting with simple tutorials can help build intuition before exploring more complex features like advanced architectures.",

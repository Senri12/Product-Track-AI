    "model_response": "The Newton-Raphson method is an iterative technique used to find successively better approximations to the roots (or zeros) of a real-valued function. Here's a structured explanation:\n\n1. **Concept**: The method works by using the tangent line at each point on the curve of the function to estimate the next guess for the root. This is based on the idea that the tangent line provides the best linear approximation near a point.\n\n2. **Mathematical Formulation**:\n   - Given a function \\( f(x) \\) and its derivative \\( f'(x) \\).\n   - Start with an initial guess \\( x_0 \\).\n   - Update the guess using the formula: \n     \\[\n     x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}\n     \\]\n   This process continues until the guesses converge to a root.\n\n3. **Conditions for Convergence**:\n   - The function \\( f(x) \\) must be differentiable around the root.\n   - The derivative \\( f'(x) \\) should not be zero at the root to avoid division by zero.\n\n4. **Example Application**: \n   - For finding the square root of 2, starting with \\( x_0 = 1 \\), iterative updates bring it closer to \\( \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.4142 \\).\n\n5. **Limitations**:\n   - If the function has repeated roots or if the derivative is zero at a point, the method may fail.\n   - Choosing an initial guess near the root can accelerate convergence.\n\n6. **Handling Special Cases**:\n   - For functions where \\( f(x) = 0 \\) at multiple points (like \\( x^2 \\)), the method might oscillate if the derivative is zero there.\n   - Care must be taken with negative values to avoid issues like the function tending towards positive infinity.\n\nIn summary, the Newton-Raphson method is a powerful tool for finding roots of functions when certain conditions are met. It efficiently narrows down the estimates by leveraging the function's slope at each point.",

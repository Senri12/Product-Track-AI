    "model_response": "Momentum in optimization refers to an acceleration mechanism that enhances the performance of optimization algorithms on flat regions or during plateaus by leveraging information from previous steps. It combines the current gradient with a fraction of the previous momentum vector, allowing larger jumps in directions where gradients are flat.\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Definition**: Momentum allows algorithms to move faster through areas with similar gradients, preventing stagnation and oscillations.\n\n2. **Mathematical Formulation**:\n   - Each parameter update is updated using a combination of the current gradient (g) and a momentum term (β).\n   - Formula: θ = θ + v; v = β * v + η * g\n     - θ is the parameter vector.\n     - v is the velocity vector.\n     - η is the learning rate.\n     - β is the momentum coefficient.\n\n3. **Practical Implications**:\n   - Combines current gradient with past updates, helping escape local minima and plateaus.\n   - Important to choose an appropriate β value; too high leads to oscillations, too low slows convergence.\n\n4. **Applications**:\n   - Nesterov's accelerated gradient (NAG) is a momentum-based method that improves convergence on smooth losses.\n   - Helps navigate complex loss landscapes smoothly by moving against gradients for a little before making the step in the velocity direction.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nMomentum in optimization enhances learning efficiency on flat regions and plateaus by combining current gradients with past updates, aiding smoother descent toward the minimum.",

    "model_response": "Euclidean metric is a mathematical concept used to measure distances between points in a flat, three-dimensional space. It is derived from the Pythagorean theorem and is defined by the formula:\n\n\\[ d(P_1, P_2) = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \\]\n\nwhere \\( P_1 = (x_1, y_1) \\) and \\( P_2 = (x_2, y_2) \\) are two points in a plane. This metric is fundamental in calculus, vector calculus, and physics, particularly in contexts such as electromagnetism, where it helps define how vectors change direction based on position.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Euclidean metric measures distance between points in 3D space using the standard formula.\n- It forms the basis for more complex mathematical operations like gradient calculations and flux analysis.",

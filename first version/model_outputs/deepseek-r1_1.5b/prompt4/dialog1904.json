    "model_response": "To determine the probability that someone will daunt a pass given weather conditions (dry, cold, warm) and their presence, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate P(water):**\n   - This is the probability that someone can water plants based on their weather and presence.\n   - Assume \"water\" means being able to water in general. If dry or cold make it harder, adjust accordingly.\n\n2. **Determine Presence:**\n   - The probability a person is present (e.g., not lost).\n\n3. **Calculate Detaching Probability:**\n   - If someone can water and is present, they might detach with a certain probability.\n   - Simplify using common sense adjustments:\n\nP(eda) = P(water) * Presence + [1 - P(water)] * Detaching\n\nWhere:\n- P(water): Probability of being able to water plants based on weather and presence.\n- Presence: Probability that the person is present.\n- Detaching: Probability of detaching once they can water.\n\n**Example Calculation:**\n\nGiven:\n- Dry = 40%\n- Cold = 25%\n- Warm = 35%\n\nAssume P(water) is calculated as (dry + warm)/2 = (40% + 35%) / 100% = 75%.\n\nPresence = 100%.\n\nP(eda) = 0.75 * 1 + [1 - 0.75] * Detaching\n\nAssuming Detaching = 50%, then:\n\nP(eda) = 0.75 + (0.25 * 0.5) = 0.875 or 87.5%\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe probability of someone daunting a pass is calculated by combining their ability to water and their presence, leading to an overall higher chance compared to the examples provided.",

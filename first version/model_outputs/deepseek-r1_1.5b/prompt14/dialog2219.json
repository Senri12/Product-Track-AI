    "model_response": "To compute the learning rate decay using the given parameters (η₀ = 0.1, t = 5, T = 10) with a linear decay method:\n\n1. **Formula Application**:\n   Use ηₜ = η₀ * (1 - t/T), where t is the step number.\n\n2. **Step-by-Step Calculation**:\n   - For each step from t=0 to t=T, compute η using the formula.\n   - At t=5: η₅ = 0.1 * (1 - 5/10) = 0.1 * 0.5 = **0.05**\n\n3. **Result**:\n   After 5 steps out of 10, the learning rate decays to **0.05**.\n\nThis linear decay ensures a smooth reduction from η₀=0.1 to zero over the course of 10 steps.",

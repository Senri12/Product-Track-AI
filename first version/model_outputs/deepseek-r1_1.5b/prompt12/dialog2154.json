    "model_response": "**Final Answer**\n\nNewton-Raphson (N-R) is an iterative method for finding roots of a differentiable function $f(x)$, using the tangent line approximation.\n\n1. **Iterative Process**: Start with an initial guess $x_0$. For each iteration:\n   - Compute $f(x_n)$ and its derivative $f'(x_n)$.\n   - Update the guess: \n     \\[\n     x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}\n     \\]\n2. **Convergence**: If derivatives are well-behaved, N-R converges quickly to a root, often quadratically.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n- For $f(x) = (x-2)^3$:\n  - Initial guess $x_0=1.5$\n  - Each iteration brings $x_n$ closer to 2.\n  \n- **Limitations**: While N-R is powerful for well-behaved functions, it may face issues like divergence if derivatives aren't suitable or function isn't smooth.\n\n**Conclusion**: Newton-Raphson is effective for root-finding with good initial guesses and smooth functions.",

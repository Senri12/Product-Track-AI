To accurately apply Bayes' theorem, one would need:\n1. Prior knowledge of disease prevalence.\n2. Specificities and sensitivities of medical tests used to assess symptoms.\n3. Observed data on the accuracy of test results.\n\nThus, with the provided information alone, it's not possible to compute a specific probability value for \\( P(\\text{Da} | \\text{москать}, \\text{лизуя}, \\text{влажно}) \\).",

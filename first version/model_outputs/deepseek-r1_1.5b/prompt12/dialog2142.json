    "model_response": "The Euclidean distance between the points (1,2) and (3,4) is calculated as follows:\n\n1. Identify the coordinates:\n   - Point A: (x₁ = 1, y₁ = 2)\n   - Point B: (x₂ = 3, y₂ = 4)\n\n2. Calculate the differences in x and y coordinates:\n   - Δx = x₂ - x₁ = 3 - 1 = 2\n   - Δy = y₂ - y₁ = 4 - 2 = 2\n\n3. Square the differences:\n   - (Δx)² = 2² = 4\n   - (Δy)² = 2² = 4\n\n4. Sum the squared differences:\n   - Total = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n5. Take the square root of the total to get the distance:\n   - Distance = √(Total) = √8 = 2√2\n\n**Answer:** The Euclidean distance between (1,2) and (3,4) is \\(2\\sqrt{2}\\).",

    "model_response": "To compute the learning rate decay with a linear schedule where η₀ = 0.1, t = 5, and T = 10, we can follow this approach:\n\n- The initial learning rate is η₀ = 0.1.\n- After completing 5 steps (t=5), the learning rate halves to η₁ = 0.05.\n- This halving occurs for each subsequent step until t reaches T=10.\n\nThus, the learning rates for each step are as follows:\n\n| Step | Learning Rate |\n|------|----------------|\n| 0    | 0.1             |\n| 1    | 0.05            |\n| 2    | 0.05            |\n| ...  | ...            |\n| 5    | 0.05            |\n| 6-9  | 0.05            |\n| 10   | 0.05            |\n\nThis linear decay ensures that the learning rate reduces by half after every 5 steps, maintaining a consistent reduction pattern throughout the training period.",

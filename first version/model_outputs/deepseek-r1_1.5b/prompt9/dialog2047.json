    "model_response": "To compute the probability of a class in a Naive Bayes classifier, follow these organized steps based on the multinomial variant:\n\n### 1. **Estimate Prior Probabilities**\n   - Calculate the proportion of emails classified as spam and non-spam across all documents. This gives the prior probabilities P(Class=Email).\n\n### 2. **Estimate Conditional Probabilities**\n   - For each feature (e.g., presence or absence of keyword), compute how likely it is to occur given the class. Use counts from each email, then divide by the total occurrences for that feature across all classes.\n   - Example: If a keyword appears in 10 out of 20 emails classified as spam, P(keyword|Spam) = 10/20.\n\n### 3. **Apply Bayes' Theorem**\n   - For a new email, multiply the prior probability by the product of conditional probabilities for each feature given the class.\n   - Use Bayes' formula: P(Class=Email|Features) = [P(Features|Class) * P(Class)] / P(Features)\n   \n### 4. **Normalization**\n   - Ensure all probabilities sum to 1 across all classes by normalizing them.\n\n### 5. **Handle Edge Cases**\n   - If a feature count is zero, adjust prior probabilities slightly for emails with no such features (e.g., Laplace smoothing).\n   - Consider edge cases where an email has no relevant keywords, which might indicate it's not spam.\n\n### 6. **Implementation Considerations**\n   - Use relative frequencies instead of absolute counts if exact data isn't available.\n   - For larger datasets or complex models, consider computational methods or software libraries.\n\nBy following these steps, you can accurately compute the probability that an email belongs to a specific class using Naive Bayes principles.",

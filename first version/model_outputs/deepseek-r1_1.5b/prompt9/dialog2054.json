    "model_response": "To compute \\( P(\\text{EDA} | \\text{passurated}, \\text{cold}, \\text{well-wet}) \\), use an economic model where Educta price is calculated as a base plus coefficients multiplied by each factor. If factors have specific values, plug them into the equation to estimate the price.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understand the Variables:**\n   - **EDA (Educta):** Filtered and pressed oil.\n   - **passurated:** Oil filtered through porous rock.\n   - **cold:** Water temperature.\n   - **well-wet:** Presence of water in the oil.\n\n2. **Economic Model Formula:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Price} = \\text{Base Price} + 1.5 \\times \\text{EDA} + 2 \\times \\text{passurated} + 3 \\times \\text{cold} + 4 \\times \\text{well-wet}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Given Values:**\n   - Base Price (hypothetical value): \\$100 per barrel.\n   - Educta Value: Given as part of the calculation.\n\n4. **Calculate Educta Price:**\n   Using the formula, substitute the known values for each factor to compute the estimated Educta price.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nTo estimate the Educta price considering the factors passurated, cold, and well-wet, use a linear model incorporating base price and coefficient multiples. This approach provides an estimate based on given data and specific coefficients.",

    "model_response": "**TensorFlow Explained**\n\n1. **What is TensorFlow?**\n   - TensorFlow is an open-source framework designed for building machine learning models, particularly neural networks.\n\n2. **Who Developed it?**\n   - Developed by Paul Laihan, who started the project during his Ph.D. studies on neural networks.\n\n3. **Key Features:**\n   - **Computation Graphs:** Manages operations to handle variables and their dependencies.\n   - **Static vs Dynamic Mode:** Static mode where graphs are defined upfront, which simplifies debugging but may require more memory.\n\n4. **Importance of TensorFlow:**\n   - Handles automatic differentiation and gradient computation for minimizing loss functions during training.\n   - Used in various industries like healthcare for image recognition and disease prediction.\n\n5. **Structure:**\n   - Includes modules and layers for model creation.\n   - Estimator classes optimize resource use without detailed inference outputs.\n   - Push Operations facilitate variable management between different parts of a model.\n\n6. **Getting Started:**\n   - Use the TensorFlow API or command-line tool to define operations graphically.\n   - Start with simple models like linear regression to grasp basics before moving to neural networks.\n\n7. **Current Status:**\n   - Version 2.x is deprecated, suggesting newer versions are less maintained but offer advanced features.\n\n**Conclusion:** TensorFlow provides a powerful framework for building efficient machine learning models through computation graphs and automatic differentiation, supported by various tools tailored to different model types.",

    "model_response": "Here’s a structured response based on your query:\n\n---\n\n### **Explanations**  \n1. **Purpose of Function F(DA):** The function \\( F(\\text{DA}) \\) computes some measure or result (e.g., the number of correct answers, total score, etc.) using the input \\( DA \\). This could be related to testing scores, computational problems, or any task where an output value is derived from a specific input.\n\n2. **Steps to Compute F(DA):**  \n   - Step 1: Analyze the input \\( DA \\) and identify its components or attributes (e.g., number of questions, time taken, etc.).  \n   - Step 2: Apply the formula or algorithm defined for \\( F(\\text{DA}) \\).  \n   - Step 3: Compute the result using the identified components.  \n   - Example: If \\( DA = 100 \\) and \\( F(DA) = \\frac{\\text{Number of Correct Answers}}{\\text{Total Number of Questions}} \\times 100 \\), then \\( F(100) = 60\\% \\times 100 = 60 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Question for Student**  \n*What is the value of \\( F(\\text{DA}) \\) if \\( DA = 50 \\)? Explain your reasoning.*  \n\n---\n\n### **Suggested Exercise**  \nCompute \\( F(\\text{DA}) \\) for different values of \\( DA \\) using a provided formula or algorithm. For example, if \\( F(DA) = (\\text{Total Points} - \\text{Incorrect Answers}) \\times 0.5 \\), calculate the result for \\( DA = 80, 60, 40 \\).  \n\n---\n\n### **Feedback Loop**  \n*After your computation, compare your answers with those of your classmates. Discuss any differences in approaches or calculations.* If you arrived at an answer that differs from others', identify where you might have made a mistake (e.g., miscounting incorrect answers) and explain how you corrected it. This collaborative exercise will enhance your understanding and problem-solving skills.  \n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like further clarification!",

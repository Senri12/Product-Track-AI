However, based on common factors:\n\n1. **Fever (Febr)**: People with fever may have different sleep patterns; higher fever can sometimes lead to reduced sleep.\n2. **Humidity (H2)**: Higher humidity might affect perceptions of temperature, influencing responses.\n\nWithout specific data or relationships between these variables, it's challenging to provide an exact probability. \n\n**Recommendation**: \n- Look into additional information or resources that connect these factors in the context you're working on.\n- Consider a dataset with similar conditions to analyze the probabilities using methods like logistic regression.",

    "model_response": "RMSProp is an optimization algorithm designed by D Andrej学习率 (Leung et al., 2012) that modifies the Adam optimizer's approach to gradient scaling. Unlike Adam, which applies momentum for velocity updates and includes clipping based on the root mean square of gradients, RMSProp scales each gradient component individually using squared terms relative to their mini-batch. \n\n**Steps in RMSProp:**\n1. **Gradient Squared:** For each parameter θ, compute the squared gradient g².\n2. **Root Mean Square (RMS):** Calculate the root mean square (RMS) of these squared gradients across the batch.\n3. **Update Rule:** Scale the current gradient by this RMS value to adjust the weight update.\n\nThis approach scales each parameter's gradient individually, avoiding the need for global normalization and handling large gradients more effectively than Adam. This makes RMSProp a robust alternative in many optimization scenarios.",

    "model_response": "To calculate the probability of a class in a Naive Bayes model, follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Calculate Prior Probabilities\n- **Prior Probability**: This represents the proportion of samples belonging to each class in the training data.\n  - For example, if there are 30 positive and 20 negative samples, their priors would be \\( \\frac{30}{50} = 0.6 \\) and \\( \\frac{20}{50} = 0.4 \\).\n\n### 2. Compute Likelihoods\n- **Likelihood**: This is the probability of each feature given a particular class.\n  - For example, if a word \"smile\" appears in 80% of positive samples and 30% of negative samples, its likelihood for positive is 0.8 and for negative is 0.3.\n\n### 3. Calculate Posterior Probability\n- **Posterior Probability**: This represents the probability that a sample belongs to a class given its features.\n  - For each feature in each class:\n    \\[ P(\\text{class}|\\text{features}) = \\prod P(\\text{feature} | \\text{class}) / P(\\text{all features}) \\]\n  - This involves multiplying the likelihoods of all features for a sample and then normalizing by the evidence.\n\n### Example Calculation\n- Suppose we have two classes: 'positive' and 'negative.'\n- Features: 'smile' and 'wearing glasses.'\n- For each class:\n  - \\( P(\\text{smile}|\\text{positive}) = 0.8 \\)\n  - \\( P(\\text{wearing glasses}|\\text{positive}) = 0.7 \\)\n  - \\( P(\\text{smile}|\\text{negative}) = 0.3 \\)\n  - \\( P(\\text{wearing glasses}|\\text{negative}) = 0.5 \\)\n\nFor a new sample:\n- **Posterior for Positive**:\n  \\[ (0.8 * 0.7) / (P(0.8*0.3 + 0.3*0.5)) \\]\n- **Posterior for Negative**:\n  \\[ (0.3 * 0.5) / (P(0.8*0.3 + 0.3*0.5)) \\]\n\n### Handling Zero Probabilities and Missing Data\n- **Zero Probabilities**: If a feature never appears in one class, its likelihood is considered zero.\n- **Missing Data**: Add a small value (e.g., 1) or default to avoid division by zero.\n\n### Conclusion\nNaive Bayes calculates the probability of each class based on independent features and multiplies their likelihoods. It's computationally efficient but performs well when assumptions hold true, especially in text classification tasks like spam detection.",

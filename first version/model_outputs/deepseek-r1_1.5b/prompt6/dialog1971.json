    "model_response": "Momentum in optimization refers to a technique that incorporates the history of gradients during parameter updates to enhance stability and acceleration. This method smooths out abrupt changes by considering past directions, preventing oscillations, and reducing noise. It is implemented by computing moving averages of gradients or squared gradients, which act as momentum terms.\n\nKey points:\n1. **Definition**: Momentum helps in stabilizing training by smoothly transitioning parameters towards the minimum.\n2. **Implementation**: In algorithms like Adam, it uses techniques such as exponential moving averages for gradient and squared gradient updates.\n3. **Types of Momentum**: Variations include RMSprop (normalization) and AdaGrad (parameter scaling), each adjusting momentum based on different criteria.\n4. **Relation to Physics**: Inspired by velocity smoothing in physics, momentum helps prevent abrupt changes caused by sudden gradient variations.\n\nMomentum accelerates convergence while stabilizing training processes across various optimization techniques. It effectively uses historical gradients to inform the next step, making it a versatile and widely adopted method in deep learning optimization.",

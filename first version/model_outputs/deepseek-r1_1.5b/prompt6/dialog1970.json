    "model_response": "SGD stands for \"Stochastic Gradient Descent,\" which is an optimization algorithm used in machine learning, particularly in training large neural networks. It's a variant of the gradient descent method that adds some randomness to the update steps to avoid getting stuck in local minima. This makes it more effective for handling large-scale datasets and deep neural networks.",

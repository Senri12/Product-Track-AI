    "model_response": "TensorFlow is an open-source framework developed by Google to enable machine learning applications to run on GPUs. It provides a wide range of tools, libraries, and utilities that allow developers to create machine learning models with GPU acceleration.\n\nKey features of TensorFlow include:\n\n1. **Graph-Based Architecture**: TensorFlow uses a computational graph to represent operations and data flow between them. This allows for the creation of complex models by composing simpler components.\n\n2. **Integration with Python**: TensorFlow is written in Python, making it accessible to developers who may not be familiar with other machine learning frameworks.\n\n3. **Versatile Models**: It supports various types of models, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and many others.\n\n4. **Support for Multiple GPUs**: TensorFlow can utilize multiple GPU cards simultaneously, allowing for faster training times when working with large datasets.\n\n5. **Extensive API and Library**: The framework comes with a comprehensive set of APIs and libraries for building models, preprocessing data, and more.\n\n6. **Real-World Applications**: TensorFlow is widely used in industry, including image recognition, natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and autonomous systems.\n\nIf you have specific questions about TensorFlow or need further details on how it works, feel free to ask!",

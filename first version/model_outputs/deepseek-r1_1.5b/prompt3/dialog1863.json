    "model_response": "Euclidean metric is a way to measure distance in a space that follows the principles of Euclidean geometry. In simpler terms, it's like how we calculate distances on a flat plane or 3D space using the Pythagorean theorem. The formula for Euclidean metric between two points \\( (x_1, y_1) \\) and \\( (x_2, y_2) \\) is:\n\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \\]\n\nThis concept extends to higher dimensions, where the distance between two points in n-dimensional space can be calculated similarly by summing the squares of the differences in each coordinate and taking the square root.",

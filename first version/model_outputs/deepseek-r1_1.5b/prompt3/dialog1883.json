    "model_response": "Learning rate refers to the speed at which a neural network or machine learning model adjusts its weights during training. It's a crucial hyperparameter in training deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The learning rate determines how quickly the model converges towards minimizing the loss function, impacting both the model's ability to generalize from training data and the efficiency of its training process. A higher learning rate can lead to faster convergence but may also result in overshooting optimal weights, while a lower learning rate ensures more stable convergence but requires more computational resources.",

    "model_response": "To compute the learning rate decay with initial η₀ = 0.1 at t=5, over a total of 10 iterations (T=10), using linear decay:\n\n- The number of decay steps D is T - (t₀) + 1 = 10 - 5 + 1 = 6.\n\nBut this depends on whether the initial rate η₀ is included in the count. If starting from t=5, the steps are 5,6,7,8,9,10 (six steps), then:\n\n- For each step t >=5:\n  η(t) = η₀ - (η₀ / D) * (t - t₀)\n  η(5) = 0.1\n  η(6) = 0.1 - (0.1/6)*(6-5)=0.0833\n  η(7)=0.0667\n  ... and so on until η(10)=0.\n\nThus, the learning rate decreases linearly from 0.1 at t=5 to 0 at t=10 after 6 steps.",

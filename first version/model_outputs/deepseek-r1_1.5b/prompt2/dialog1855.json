    "model_response": "RMSProp is an optimization algorithm used in machine learning and deep learning training to minimize a loss function by adjusting parameter updates. It stands for Root Mean Square Proposition, combining the concept of root mean square (RMS) from statistics with the idea of a rule or strategy.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n1. **Gradient Adjustment:** RMSProp adjusts parameter updates using the root mean square of past gradients instead of just the sum or squared sum. This approach is similar to how L2 regularization works, penalizing larger weights more.\n\n2. **Adaptive Learning Rates:** Unlike Adam which uses a fixed learning rate decaying over time, RMSProp does not have this feature. This means it maintains an initial larger learning rate to explore parameter space thoroughly without averaging gradients away too quickly.\n\n3. **Moment Normalization:** It maintains two moving averages: one for the current moment and another that increases over time. This balance helps in smoothing out gradients while preserving important features from past updates.\n\n4. **Application:** RMSProp is particularly useful for models where specific data properties are important, such as L2-loss models. It can be applied to various tasks including document classification, text regression, and recommendation systems.\n\nIn summary, RMSProp is an optimization method that adapts parameter updates using root mean squares of past gradients, offering a balance between gradient smoothing and parameter exploration.",

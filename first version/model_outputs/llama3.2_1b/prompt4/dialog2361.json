    "model_response": "Я знаю, что sometimes things can be really complicated. Let me try explaining something that's really cool.\n\nМоментум - это kinda like a \"force\" in optimization problems. You see, when we're trying to figure out the best solution to a problem, there are often many different possible solutions, and each one has its own advantages and disadvantages.\n\nImagine you have a big bag of different colored balls, and each ball represents a possible solution. The momentum of the system (in this case, our optimization problem) is like the \"center\" of all these balls. It's the average position or direction that the system tends to move towards.\n\nWhen we're optimizing something, we want to find the system with the highest momentum - the one that will take us farthest in the right direction. But here's the thing: if there are many different solutions with high momentum, but also some solutions with low momentum, it can be really hard to pick just one.\n\nThat's where the concept of \"optimal\" comes in. Optimal means finding the system with the highest momentum (i.e., the best solution). It's like finding the ball that is furthest away from the bag of balls - it's the solution that we want most.\n\nBut here's a trick: sometimes, instead of trying to find the optimal solution by calculating its momentum directly, we can use another concept called \"optimality\" or \"feasibility\". Optimality means whether a given solution is possible in the first place. If it's feasible, then it's likely to have good momentum and be close to being optimal.\n\nSo, to sum it up: momentum in optimization problems refers to the tendency of a system towards its optimal state, while optimal means finding the system with the highest momentum (i.e., the best solution).",

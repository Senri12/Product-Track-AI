    "model_response": "Learning rate is a fundamental hyperparameter in machine learning algorithms that determines how quickly (or slowly) our model learns during training.\n\nIn other words, it controls the size of updates to the weights given with respect to gradients calculated for each input sample at every iteration or epoch while updating these parameters. A higher learning rate means your algorithm will learn more from data but can also easily overshoot optimal solutions; a lower one implies slower progress and might get stuck in local minima.\n\nA suitable practice problem: Consider you have trained an artificial neural network to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset, with initial settings for learning rate as 0.01 and epochs set at 100:\n\n1. Explain what would happen if we increase this learning rate significantly (e.g., from 0.01 to 1) while keeping everything else constant.\n2. Predict how changing it back downwards after reaching the maximum number of iterations might affect your final model performance.\n\nThe student's answers should reflect an understanding that increasing too high a value can cause instability or failure in convergence, and decreasing may lead to underfitting but potentially better generalization with more epochs if done correctly.",

    "model_response": "RMSprop stands for Root Mean Square Propagation. It's an optimization algorithm used to adjust learning rates during training machine learning models by dividing them proportionally based on recent gradients' magnitudes.\n\n- Clarification Needed: Do you understand the concept, or would like further explanation of how it adjusts learning rates?\n\n\nIf clarification is needed:\n\n\nRMSprop aims to reduce oscillations and improve convergence in deep neural networks. It keeps track of an exponentially decaying average square gradient vector for each weight which helps adaptively change the learning rate.\n\n\n- Confirmation: Does this help you understand what RMSProp does, or do we need further details?",

    "model_response": "To clarify your request:\n\nYou're asking to calculate a linearly decaying learning rate given an initial learning rate (η₀) at time zero and how it changes over 5 epochs out of total training periods which amount up to epoch number 'T'. The decay should be applied in such way that the learning rate decreases uniformly between these two points.\n\nBased on this, can you confirm if I have understood your request correctly? If yes, I'll proceed with computing a linearly decaying function for η(t) where t ranges from 0 (initial time/epoch start point) to T.",

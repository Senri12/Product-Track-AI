    "model_response": "RMSprop, which stands for Root Mean Square Propagation, is an adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm designed specifically to address some of the shortcomings encountered with traditional stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in deep neural networks training.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what it does:\n\n1. **Adaptive Learning Rate**: RMSProp adjusts the learning rates dynamically throughout the course of your model's iterations or epochs by dividing each parameter update by an exponentially decaying average of squared gradients, which helps to reduce oscillations and improves convergence rate for highly non-stationary objectives (like deep neural networks).\n\n2. **Handling Non-Stationarity**: Unlike traditional methods that have a fixed learning rate throughout the training process — potentially leading them off course as they converge on complex landscapes with many local minima or saddle points, RMSProp helps to keep your steps more informed and adaptive.\n\n3. **Improving Convergence Speed & Stability**: By adapting at each parameter's location based on historical gradients (mean square), it tends to stabilize the learning process across different variables by preventing too large an update of parameters with small gradient magnitudes; this can be particularly useful in deep neural networks where some weights might naturally require smaller updates compared others.\n\n### How RMSProp Works\n\n1. **Initialize**: Set initial values for your gradients (usually zeros) and keep a running average squared value.\n2. **Compute Gradients**: Compute the gradients of parameters with respect to loss at each iteration/batch training step using backpropagation in deep learning models or derivative calculations otherwise.\n\n3. **Update Running Average Squared Gradient Value**:\n   $$\\hat{v_t} = \\beta * v_{t-1} + (1 - \\beta) * g_t^2$$\n   Here, $\\hat{v}_t$ is the running average squared gradient at time step $t$, with $\\beta \\in [0.99..], 0 < β < 1,$ typically set to around `0.9`. This controls how quickly old information (previous gradients) influences new updates.\n\n4. **Adjust Learning Rate**: Update your parameters using an adaptive learning rate:\n   $$\\theta_{t+1} = \\theta_t - (\\eta / ||g_t|| + \\epsilon ) * g_t$$\n   \nHere, $\\theta$ represents the parameter values at time $t$, and similarly for subsequent times. The term $(η/||g_t||+\\epsilon)$ adjusts learning rate based on running average squared gradient.\n\n### Analogous Problem Example\n\nConsider you're trying to climb a mountain with varying slopes: RMSProp would help you adjust your steps depending upon previous terrain conditions (i.e., gradients) experienced, making it easier for smoother sections and less strenuous adjustments in rocky terrains. This results into an adaptive pace that maintains overall stability while speeding up convergence.\n\n### Practical Use\n\n- **Keras Implementation**:\n  In Keras deep learning library; RMSprop optimizer can be used as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom keras.optimizers import RMSprop\n\n# Create your model here...\nmodel = ...\n\nrms_prop_optimizer = RMSprop(learning_rate=0.001, rho=0.9)\nmodel.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy',\n              optimizer=rms_prop_optimizer,\n              metrics=['accuracy'])\n```\n\n- **Custom Implementation**:\n  You can also create a custom function or class to implement this manually if you prefer not using built-in optimizers.\n\nBy employing RMSProp in your neural network training, you're taking advantage of an adaptive learning strategy that helps overcome some challenges posed by traditional methods like SGD. This leads generally results with fewer iterations and better performance when working on complex models (like deep networks).\n\nThis is why it's particularly popular for tasks involving large-scale data or highly non-linear problems which require a dynamic approach to adjusting the step sizes during training.\n\nI hope this explanation clarifies how RMSProp works!

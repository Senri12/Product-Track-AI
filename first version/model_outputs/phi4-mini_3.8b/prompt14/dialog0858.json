    "model_response": "Keras is an open-source software library that provides tools for building deep learning models, particularly neural networks with highly scalable architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) etc.\n\nDeveloped by scientists from academia including the University of California Berkeley and Google Brain team Keras was designed to enable fast experimentation through a user-friendly interface. It runs on top of TensorFlow, Theano or Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit as backend engines for computation in different platforms like Windows, Linux Mac OS X and Android devices.\n\nKeras provides high-level APIs that can be used with multiple languages such as Python, JavaScript etc., making it widely accessible to people who want learn deep learning. It also has a large community which continually contribute tutorials & examples of working code snippets on its official website. \n\nOne notable feature is Keras being very flexible and allowing customization for more specific needs or applications in neural networks like transfer learning (where pre-trained models can be used as basis), fine-tuning etc.\n\nOverall, it makes building deep-learning based systems much easier with a user-friendly interface that allows experimentation even to beginners without getting lost into the complexities of lower-level programming languages. Its main purpose is not only solving problems but also enabling new ideas and creativity through its simple-to-use tools! \n\nSo whether you are just starting out in Machine Learning or an experienced practitioner looking for faster ways than writing code from scratch, Keras can be a useful tool to explore deep learning applications & algorithms efficiently without getting overwhelmed by details. It provides freedom that encourages exploration of the field with little effort required compared traditional methods requiring lengthy coding! \n\nIn conclusion: \nKeras is one such library which offers great features making it popular among Machine Learning Developers and Researchers for developing, prototyping quickly or even building production-ready models especially those focused on neural networks architectures like CNNs & RNN etc. Overall Keras can be considered as a helpful tool when dealing with deep learning applications providing simple yet powerful tools!",

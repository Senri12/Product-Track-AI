    "model_response": "Sure! Let's walk you through calculating a parameter update in AdamGrad, which is an extension of the standard ADAM optimizer that includes elements from AdaGrad.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( G_{t-1,i} = 4 \\) (squared gradients at time step t-1 for variable i)\n- \\( g_t = 2 \\) (gradient with respect to some loss function w.r.t. a parameter vector component v_i, observed in the current iteration t or time-step 't')\n- Learning rate (\\(\\eta\\)) is set as 0.1\n- Epsilon value (\\(\\epsilon\\)), which helps maintain numerical stability by preventing division by zero, is \\( \\varepsilon = 10^{-8} \\)\n\nLet's calculate both terms required for updating a parameter in AdamGrad.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Step 1: Update biased first moment estimate (m_t)**\nThe update rule typically used here would look like:\n\\[ m_{t,i}^{new} = g_t + c_1 * G_{t-1,ii} \\]\nWhere \\(c_1\\) is the decay rate for moving average. For AdamGrad's variant and given your standard ADAM setup (noting that specific values of 'beta' might differ), let's assume a typical value like 0.9.\n\nGiven:\n\\[ g_t = 2 \\] \n\\[ G_{t-1,i} = 4 \\]\nAssume \\( c_1 = 0.9\\):\n\nSo,\n\\[ m_{t, i}^{new} = (1 - b) * g_t + b * ((g_t^2 / T_i^(l+))^{(1-b)} )=  G_{t-1,i}\\]\n\n**Step 2: Update biased second moment estimate (V_t)**\n\nThe update rule used here would look like:\n\\[ V_{t,ii}^{new} = \\eta * g_t + c_2 * ((g_t^2 / T_i^(l+))^{(b)})\\]\nWhere \\(c_2\\), often set to 0.999 for ADAM\n\nAssuming similar decay rates as before,\n\nGiven:\n\\[ g_t = 2 \\]\n\nLet's compute both terms needed using the specified values:\n\n1. First Moment Update (m):\n   - Assuming m is initialized and b=beta.\n   \nUsing \\(c_1\\) value assumed, let's proceed step by step for clarity.\n\n**Assumed parameters**\n\n\\( c_1 = 0.9 \\\\ V_t^{new} \\)\n\n2. Second moment update using previous values:\n\\[V_{t,i}^{new}= g_t + c_2 * ((g_t^2 / T_i^(l+))^{(b)})= G_{t-1,ii}\\]\n\n**Summarizing final updates:**\n\nGiven we don't have the full context of beta and other hyperparameters directly,\n\nSo,\n\\[ m_{i}^{new} = (0.9 )* g_t +  c_2 * ((g_t^2 / T_i^(l+))^{(b)})\\]\nAnd similarly V updated accordingly.\n\nHope this helps in understanding the parameter updates for AdamGrad based on your given values and further steps required as per full context!",

    "model_response": "**Explanation:** The choice of 'k' in k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) is crucial as it determines how many neighbors are considered when making predictions about a new data point's class or value.\n\n**Question for Student:** Why do you think choosing the right number for your neighbor count, `k`, matters?\n\n**Suggested Exercise:** Experiment with different values of 'k' on historical datasets to observe and compare their impact. Begin by setting up several models using k-NN where each model has a distinct neighborhood size (e.g., 1-10). Record performance metrics like accuracy or mean squared error for classification/regression problems respectively.\n\n**Feedback Loop:** After running the experiments, reflect upon which values of 'k' provided better outcomes and why. Discuss factors such as overfitting/underfitting risks associated with too low/high `k`. Share insights on how to balance between bias (error from erroneous assumptions) versus variance (error due to sensitivity to fluctuations in training data).",

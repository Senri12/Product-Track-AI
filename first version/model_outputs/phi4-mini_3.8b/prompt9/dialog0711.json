    "model_response": "**Explanation:**\nMomentum in optimization is inspired by physics' concept of momentum where an object continues moving unless acted upon by another force (Newton's first law). In machine learning algorithms like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), a variant called Nesterov Accelerated Gradient or simply \"Momentum\" incorporates this idea to improve the convergence rate towards optimal solutions.\n\nThe Momentum term helps in accelerating gradients vectors while also averaging them. This mitigates oscillations and reduces overshooting, leading to faster convergence especially when dealing with noisy data or high-dimensional spaces.\n\n\n**Question for Student:**\n\nHow does incorporating momentum help an optimization algorithm like SGD?\n\n\n**Suggested Exercise:**\n\n\nImplement a simple gradient descent function without Momentum on your favorite machine learning framework (like TensorFlow/PyTorch) using some dataset of choice, and then modify it to include the Momentum term. Observe how each version performs in terms of convergence speed.\n\n\n**Feedback Loop:**\n\nWhen you observe that adding momentum helps with faster or smoother optimization compared to SGD alone, note down what aspects make a difference—the acceleration effect reduces oscillations around minima which is visually evident when plotting loss over iterations.\n\nIf there's any confusion about the concept's intuition behind Momentum being helpful for quicker convergence and better stability in learning algorithms like neural networks training on high-dimensional data spaces (like images), you can revisit why it's akin to an object gaining speed while moving down a hill, resisting fluctuations from bumps along its path.",

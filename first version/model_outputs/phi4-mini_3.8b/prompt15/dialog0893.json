    "model_response": "Learning rate is a hyperparameter in machine learning that determines how quickly or slowly an algorithm will learn from training data during optimization procedures like gradient descent.\n\nA high learning rate can cause rapid convergence but also lead to overshooting of the minimum point we are trying to find, leading to instability and poor results. On the other hand, too low a learning rate makes progress towards optimality very slow which may result in excessively long computation times or getting stuck at local minima without reaching global ones.\n\nA good practice is usually trial-and-error with different values for finding an ideal one that ensures stability while still being efficient during training time.\n\n\nFollow-up question: What are some ways to determine the best learning rate before starting a full-scale model optimization?",

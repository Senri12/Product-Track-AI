    "model_response": "Adam is typically referred to in biblical contexts within Christianity; he was created according to Christian doctrine by God out of nothing (ex nihilo) as mentioned in Genesis 1:27 (\"So God created man ('adam) in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female ('ishshah va'ish), He created them.\") In this context, Adam is seen not only literally but also figuratively—as a representation or archetype. If you're referring to 'Adam Smith,' he was an influential 18th-century Scottish economist known for his work in moral philosophy as well.\n\nIf your reference pertains specifically to another \"Adam,\" such as software (e.g., Microsoft Excel's Adam function), please provide further details so I can assist you accurately with the correct context.",

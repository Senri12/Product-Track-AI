    "model_response": "Key Points:\n- Momentum is a popular optimization algorithm used in training deep learning models.\n- It works by using the previous gradient to smooth out updates and accelerate convergence\n- The formula for updating weights with momentum can be written as: v_t = γ * v_{t-1} + η * ∇L, where v_t represents current velocity vector or momentum at time step t,\n  γ (gamma) is a parameter called the learning rate which controls how much we should update our parameters based on previous gradients.\n  δ(L_v)_x(t) = γ*v_(t−1)(δ(L_x)_v(x)) + η*∇L\n- In this example, we're given: v_t-1=1 (previous velocity vector), ∇L=2 (gradient of the loss function with respect to weights at time t),\n  and η=0.1 as learning rate.\n\nQuiz Questions:\n\n1) What is Momentum used for in deep learning?\n\nAnswer: To accelerate convergence during training by smoothing out updates based on previous gradients\n\n2) Write down the formula that calculates v_t using momentum optimization algorithm given γ, v_{t-1}, ∇L and η parameters. \n\nAnswer: v_t = γ * v_{t-1} + η * ∇L\n\n\nRevisiting Weak Areas:\n\nQuestion 3 - Explain how Momentum helps to prevent getting stuck in local minima during the training process.\n\nAnswer (Expected): By using previous gradients, it allows for smoother updates and better exploration of parameter space. This prevents premature convergence which might lead us into a sub-optimal point such as an undesired minimum.\n\n\nTargeted Questions:\n\n1) What happens when you increase γ beyond 0.9 in momentum optimization? Explain.\n\nAnswer (Expected): Increasing the learning rate can cause overshooting leading to unstable training or getting stuck at local minima due to excessive velocity accumulation\n\n2) How does reducing η affect convergence speed with Momentum?\n\nAnswer (Expected): Decreasing β reduces update size, slowing down convergence but preventing oscillations around optimal weights. The balance between updating too fast and too slow is crucial for efficient learning.\n\n3) What could happen if we start training without setting v_t-1 to any initial value like 0? Explain your answer with respect to Momentum's role in optimization algorithms.\n\nAnswer (Expected): Without an initialized previous velocity vector, the algorithm wouldn't have a starting point from which momentum can accelerate convergence. As such it would essentially behave as vanilla gradient descent until some initialization step is performed or otherwise specified within the code structure. This emphasizes how necessary pre-defined initial conditions are to enable Momentum's benefits on parameter updates and subsequent model training effectiveness.",

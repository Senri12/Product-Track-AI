    "model_response": "**Summary:**\n\nOverfitting is an issue in machine learning where your model becomes excessively complex to such degrees that it starts \"memorizing\" or closely fitting not just the underlying patterns of data but also its random noise (random fluctuations specific to a particular dataset). This happens when there are too many parameters relative to relevant features, making predictions very accurate on training and validation datasets while failing miserably at predicting new observations.\n\n**Quiz Question:**\n\n1. Can you explain why overfitting occurs in machine learning models? Choose the best answer below:\n\n    A) It's a result of using an overly simple model that can't capture complex patterns.\n    \n    B) It happens when there's too much information noise compared to useful signal, leading to memorization rather than generalizing from data.\n\n    C) Overfitting is mainly caused by incorrect labels in your dataset which confuse the learning algorithm.\n\n\n**Weak Area Revisit and Explanation:**\n\nThe correct answer here would be **B)**. This choice accurately describes overfitting as occurring when there's an imbalance between information noise (random fluctuations not important to understanding patterns within data; essentially, irrelevant details) compared with useful signal -- leading a model that memorizes these intricacies instead of learning the generalizable underlying trends in the dataset.\n\nOverfitting can drastically reduce your model's performance on unseen or new datasets because it has tuned its parameters too closely based upon idiosyncrasies specific to one particular sample set. To combat overfitting, techniques such as cross-validation (to ensure that models perform well across different subsets of data), pruning in decision trees and reducing the complexity/sparsity can be used.\n\nAdditionally, incorporating regularization methods like Lasso or Ridge regression into your learning process helps by penalizing overly complex model structures—thus discouraging them from fitting too closely to random noise within training datasets.",

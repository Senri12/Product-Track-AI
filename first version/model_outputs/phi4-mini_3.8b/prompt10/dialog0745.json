    "model_response": "RMSProp stands for Root Mean Square Propagation. It is a type of optimization algorithm used in machine learning to update network weights more effectively during training.\n\nHere's an overview:\n\n1. **Root Mean Square (RMS)**: This term refers to calculating the root mean square value, which helps normalize gradients by accounting for their magnitude.\n2. **Propagation**: In this context, it means updating or propagating information through layers in a neural network model based on calculated errors.\n\nThe RMSProp algorithm maintains an exponentially decaying average of squared gradients and uses these averages as part of the denominator to scale learning rates at different parameters during training:\n\n- This approach helps mitigate issues with oscillations that can occur when using standard Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) by adapting each parameter's learning rate individually based on recent history.\n- RMSProp works well in scenarios where gradients vary significantly, which is common for deep networks and recurrent neural network models.\n\nI hope this explanation provides a good starting point. Let me know if you need further details or clarifications!",

    "model_response": "Adagrad is an optimization algorithm that adapts learning rates based on past gradients to improve performance for sparse data problems.\n\nThe update rule in Adam optimizer (which includes Adagrad as a special case) takes into account the accumulated squared gradient $G_{t,i}$ at time step t and updates it according to:\n\n$$\ng_t = \\frac{\\text{grad}_i}{\\sqrt{{S}_{t-1,ii} + 10^{-8}}}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\eta$ is a learning rate (typically around 0.001), $ε=1e-8$ for numerical stability.\n\nIf you are using this formula in your code or calculations:\n```python\nG_t_minus_1 = 4    # G_{t-1,ii} at time step t - 1.\ng_t              = 2      # Gradient g_t at the current iteration (time step).\nη                 = 0.1   # Learning rate η.\n\nS_t             = S_t_minus_1 + ε * np.square(g_t)    # Update squared gradient sum, adding epsilon for numerical stability\n```\n\nYou can calculate $g_{t}$ as follows:\n$$ g_t = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{{4} + 10^{-8}}}\\approx0.31622776601683794 $$\n\nSo the updated parameter with this new value will be calculated using Adam's update rule.\n\nRemember, it is essential to maintain numerical stability in these calculations by including a small constant $ε$. It prevents division errors when updating parameters for very large or extremely sparse gradients (which are common challenges Adagrad aims at addressing).",

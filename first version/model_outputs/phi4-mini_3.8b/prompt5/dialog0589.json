    "model_response": "Overfitting occurs when an artificial intelligence (AI) model learns not just from actual patterns in data but also captures noise or random fluctuations as if they were meaningful trends within its training dataset. As a result of this excessive learning and memorization:\n\n1. The AI performs exceptionally well on the specific, original set used for development.\n2. However, it fails to generalize effectively when exposed to new datasets not encountered during its initial fitting process.\n\nThis can lead to poor performance in real-world applications or predictions because an overfitted model is overly complex and tuned too closely towards particular nuances of a dataset that don't necessarily represent the underlying concept being modeled.\n\n\nTo test comprehension with challenging tasks:\n\n1. Describe how you would diagnose whether your machine learning model suffers from over-fitting.\n2. Propose strategies to prevent overfitting when designing AI models for real-world applications.",

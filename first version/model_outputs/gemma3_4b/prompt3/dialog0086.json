    "model_response": "Okay, let's tackle this! We're dealing with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and a simple loss function.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe have a loss function, L(w) = w², and we're trying to minimize it. We're given a weight, w = 3, and a learning rate, η = 0.1. SGD uses the gradient of the loss function to update the weights.\n\n**Question 1:** Can you briefly explain in your own words what the gradient of a function represents? (Think about the slope of a line.) Don’t worry about a formal definition - just your understanding. Take a moment to think about this.\n",

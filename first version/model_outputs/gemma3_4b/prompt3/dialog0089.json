    "model_response": "Okay, let's tackle this learning rate decay problem! We're given:\n\n*   η₀ (initial learning rate) = 0.1\n*   t (time step) = 5\n*   T (total number of steps) = 10\n*   Linear decay\n\n**Step 1: Understand Linear Decay**\n\nLinear decay means the learning rate decreases by a constant amount over time.  We need to figure out how much it decreases at each step.\n\n**Question 1:**  Based on the information given, what kind of function do you think describes the learning rate over time in this scenario? (Hint: think about the word \"linear\") \n\nLet me know your answer, and we'll move on to calculating the learning rate at time 't'.",

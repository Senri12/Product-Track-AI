It looks like we're dealing with conditional probability. \n\nFirst, let’s break down what we’re trying to calculate:  P(да | пасмурно, холодно, влажно, да).\n\nThis reads as: \"The probability of saying 'yes' *given* that it's cloudy, cold, and humid, and also the person says 'yes'.\"\n\n**Question 1:** Can you explain to me in your own words what a conditional probability is?  Essentially, what are we trying to find here? Don't just give me a definition, try to illustrate it with an example if you can.",

    "model_response": "Okay, let's tackle this Nesterov update calculation. We're given:\n\n*   γ = 0.9 (the discount factor)\n*   v = 1 (the current value estimate)\n*   ∇ = 2 (the gradient we're using)\n\nWe need to calculate the update to the value estimate `v` using the Nesterov method.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Nesterov Update**\n\nThe Nesterov update rule is:\n\n`v_t = v_{t-1} - γ * ∇ * (v_{t-1} - v_{t-1})`\n\nLet's break this down. We're taking the old value `v_{t-1}`, subtracting a scaled gradient, and then updating the value.\n\n**Question 1:**  Can you briefly explain in your own words what the Nesterov update is trying to achieve?  (Don't just repeat the formula – think about *why* we're doing this.)",

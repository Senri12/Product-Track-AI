You're asking me to calculate F(да) for a test, and you've given the example of \"weather.\"\n\nTo help me understand exactly what you need, could you tell me:\n\n1. **What is \"F(да)\"?**  I need to know what this notation represents. Is it a formula? A function? Can you give me the definition of F(да)?\n\n2. **What kind of test are we talking about?** The word \"test\" is a little vague.  Are we talking about a:\n    *   Statistical test?\n    *   A test in a specific subject (like math or science)?\n    *   Something else entirely?\n\n3. **What is \"да\" in this context?**  This looks like a variable, but what does \"да\" represent within the test or example?  Is it a specific data point, a category, or something else?\n\nOnce I have a clearer understanding of these points, I can help you calculate F(да). \n\nLet's start with the first question: **What is F(да)?**  Please tell me what F(да) means in this situation.",

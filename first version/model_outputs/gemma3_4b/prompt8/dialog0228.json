    "model_response": "Okay, let's tackle what Keras is. It's a really popular tool, but the initial explanation can be a bit confusing. \n\nHere’s how I’ll break it down:\n\n**Essentially, Keras is a high-level API (Application Programming Interface) for building and training artificial neural networks.**\n\nLet’s unpack that a bit:\n\n* **Neural Networks:** These are computer models inspired by the human brain. They’re used for things like image recognition, natural language processing, and predicting trends.\n* **API:** Think of an API like a translator. It allows different software programs to talk to each other. In this case, Keras acts as a translator between you (the programmer) and the underlying mathematical operations needed to build and train a neural network.\n* **High-Level:** This means Keras simplifies the process of building neural networks.  You don't need to worry about all the low-level details of how the network is constructed.\n\n**A simpler analogy:** Imagine you want to bake a cake. You could gather all the ingredients, measure them perfectly, and mix them yourself (low-level). Or you could use a cake mix – it’s already prepared and you just add the water and eggs (high-level). Keras is like that cake mix for neural networks.\n\n**Now, Keras has a history:**  It started as a research project at Google and is now part of TensorFlow. However, it's often used independently, and has its own distinct API.\n\n---\n\n**To make sure we're on the same page, let’s check your understanding:**\n\n1.  **Could you tell me in your own words what you *think* a neural network is?** (Don’t worry if you don’t get it perfectly - this is just to see where we're starting.)\n\n2.  **Do you understand the idea of an API simplifying a process?**  Can you give me a simple example of a time you've used something that made a complicated process easier? (e.g., a calculator, a recipe, etc.)\n\nLet me know your answers to those two questions, and we can continue!  Don’t hesitate to ask if anything is unclear.",

    "model_response": "Okay, let’s tackle “Что такое TensorFlow?” (What is TensorFlow?). This is a really important question!\n\nEssentially, **TensorFlow is a powerful open-source library for numerical computation and large-scale machine learning.**\n\nLet’s break that down:\n\n* **Numerical Computation:**  It's a tool that helps you perform complex mathematical operations – things like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and more complicated things like matrix calculations (which are *really* important in machine learning).\n\n* **Large-Scale Machine Learning:** This is where TensorFlow *really* shines. Machine learning is about teaching computers to learn from data, just like humans do. TensorFlow provides the tools and infrastructure to build and train very large and sophisticated machine learning models.\n\n**Here's a slightly simpler way to think about it:** Imagine you’re building a robot that can recognize faces. TensorFlow gives you the building blocks – the instructions and tools – to create the \"brain\" (the machine learning model) that allows the robot to learn to identify faces.\n\n\n**Now, let's check your understanding.  To make sure we're on the same page, can you tell me:**\n\n1.  **In your own words, what do you think “machine learning” is?** (Don’t worry if you're not completely sure – just give me your best guess!)\n2.  **Do you understand that TensorFlow helps *build* machine learning models?** (Yes/No/Partially)\n\n\nOnce you answer those two questions, we can delve deeper into specific aspects of TensorFlow.",

    "model_response": "Okay, let's break down what the Newton-Raphson method is. It's a common and powerful technique used in mathematics and computer science to find approximate solutions to equations. \n\nHere's a breakdown, and I'll pause here to check your understanding:\n\n**What it is:**\n\nThe Newton-Raphson method is an *iterative* method. This means it starts with an initial guess and then repeatedly refines that guess until it gets close enough to the actual solution. \n\n**Here’s how it works:**\n\n1. **You start with an initial guess, let’s call it 'x₀'.** This guess doesn't need to be very accurate; it just needs to be somewhere near the solution you're looking for.\n\n2. **You calculate the *derivative* of the function you're trying to solve, let’s call it f(x).** The derivative, often written as f'(x), tells you the slope of the function at any given point.\n\n3. **You use the following formula to get the next, improved guess (x₁):**\n\n   x₁ = x₀ - f(x₀) / f'(x₀)\n\n4. **You repeat step 3, using x₁ as your new x₀.**  So you’ll calculate x₂ = x₁ - f(x₁) / f'(x₁) and so on.\n\n5. **You keep repeating until the difference between successive guesses (xᵢ₊₁ - xᵢ) is smaller than a certain tolerance.** This tolerance determines how accurate your solution will be.\n\n\n**Let's use a simple example:**\n\nSuppose you want to find the root of the equation f(x) = x² - 2 = 0 (which means you want to find the value of x where x² = 2).\n\n*   f(x) = x² - 2\n*   f'(x) = 2x\n\nNow, let's start with an initial guess, x₀ = 1:\n\n*   x₁ = 1 - (1² - 2) / (2 * 1) = 1 - (-1) / 2 = 1.5\n*   x₂ = 1.5 - (1.5² - 2) / (2 * 1.5) = 1.5 - (0.25) / 3 = 1.41666...\n*   And so on...\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n*   It's an *approximation* method – it doesn't always guarantee finding the exact solution.\n*   The choice of initial guess can affect how quickly the method converges (how quickly it gets to the solution).\n*   It's particularly useful for finding roots (zeros) of equations.\n\n---\n\n**Okay, let’s check your understanding so far.  Can you tell me in your own words what the main goal of the Newton-Raphson method is?**  Don't worry about getting every detail right, just give me a general idea.",

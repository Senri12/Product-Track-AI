    "model_response": "Okay, let's calculate the Euclidean distance between the points (1, 2) and (3, 4).\n\nThe Euclidean distance formula is:\n\n√((x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)² )\n\nWhere:\n* (x₁, y₁) are the coordinates of the first point (in our case, (1, 2))\n* (x₂, y₂) are the coordinates of the second point (in our case, (3, 4))\n\nLet's plug in the values:\n\nDistance = √((3 - 1)² + (4 - 2)²)\n       = √((2)² + (2)²)\n       = √(4 + 4)\n       = √8\n       = 2√2\n\nTherefore, the Euclidean distance between (1, 2) and (3, 4) is 2√2.\n\n**Now, I'd like to check your understanding.**\n\n1.  Can you briefly explain *why* we use the square root in the Euclidean distance formula? What does it represent in this context?\n\n2.  What would the distance between the points (0, 0) and (5, 5) be, according to this formula?  Show your calculations.",

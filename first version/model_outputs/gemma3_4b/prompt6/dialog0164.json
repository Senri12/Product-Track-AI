First, let's make sure we understand exactly what that notation means.\n\n1. **What does the \"|\" symbol represent in this context?** (Think about what it means to have something *conditional* on something else.)\n\nDon’t just tell me the definition.  Let's try to *understand* what the statement is saying.  What does it mean to say \"P(да | пасмурно, холодно, влажно, да)\"?  What are we trying to figure out?",

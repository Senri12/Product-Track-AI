    "model_response": "Okay, let’s break down calculating the learning rate decay with the given parameters.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nWe’re dealing with a linear learning rate decay schedule. This means the learning rate decreases linearly over time. We're given:\n\n*   **η₀ (Initial Learning Rate):** 0.1\n*   **t (Current Time Step):** 5\n*   **T (Total Number of Time Steps):** 10\n\nThe formula for linear decay is:\n\nη(t) = η₀ * (1 - t/T)\n\nWhere:\n\n*   η(t) is the learning rate at time step *t*\n*   η₀ is the initial learning rate\n*   t is the current time step\n*   T is the total number of time steps\n\n**Question for Student:**\n\nCan you calculate the learning rate (η(t)) at time step *t* = 5 using the given parameters? Show your work.  What is the final learning rate at the end of the training (t=T)?\n\n\n**Suggested Exercise:**\n\nPlease manually calculate η(5) and η(10) using the formula above. Write down the steps you took to arrive at your answer. This will help solidify your understanding of the decay formula.\n\n\n\n**Feedback Loop:**\n\n(I will be responding to your calculation. Please provide your answer.)\n\n*   **If your answer is correct:** \"Excellent! You've correctly applied the linear decay formula.  This demonstrates a strong understanding of how learning rates decrease over time.  Let's discuss how this schedule might be appropriate in different training scenarios...\"\n*   **If your answer is incorrect:** \"Let's revisit the formula. Remember, we're calculating the learning rate *at* time step *t*.  Make sure you correctly substitute the values into the equation.  Do you want me to walk you through the calculation again, step-by-step?\"",

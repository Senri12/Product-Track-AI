    "model_response": "Okay, let's break down the concept of Chebyshev polynomials.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nChebyshev polynomials, denoted as *T<sub>n</sub>(x)*, are a set of orthogonal polynomials defined using the recursive formula:\n\n*   *T<sub>0</sub>(x) = 1*\n*   *T<sub>1</sub>(x) = x*\n*   *T<sub>n+1</sub>(x) = 2xT<sub>n</sub>(x) - T<sub>n-1</sub>(x)*  for *n > 1*\n\nThis recursive definition means that each polynomial is built from the previous two.  They are particularly useful in approximation theory, especially for approximating functions that are smooth and periodic. Importantly, they are *orthogonal* on the interval [-1, 1]. This means the integral of the product of two Chebyshev polynomials of the same degree over that interval is zero.\n\n**Question for Student:**\n\nCan you describe, in your own words, what \"orthogonal\" means in the context of these polynomials?  (Don't worry about a formal definition, just your understanding based on the explanation.)\n\n\n\n**Suggested Exercise:**\n\nLet's calculate the first few Chebyshev polynomials:\n\n*   Calculate *T<sub>0</sub>(x)*, *T<sub>1</sub>(x)*, *T<sub>2</sub>(x)*, and *T<sub>3</sub>(x)* using the recursive formula.  (You can use x = 1 for this calculation to keep it manageable).\n\n\n\n**Feedback Loop:**\n\n(I’ll be checking your answers to the exercise.  After you've attempted it, I will provide targeted feedback.  For now, let’s just acknowledge that this is a fundamental step in understanding Chebyshev polynomials – understanding and applying the recursive formula is key). Let me know when you've tried the exercise!",

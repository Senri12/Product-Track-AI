    "model_response": "Okay, let's break down what Keras is, based on the information we have.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nKeras is an open-source deep learning API written in Python.  It’s designed to be user-friendly and flexible, making it a popular choice for both beginners and experienced researchers.  Crucially, Keras *doesn't* contain its own underlying computation engine. Instead, it sits on top of frameworks like TensorFlow, Theano, or CNTK. This allows Keras to be easily switched between these engines, offering a lot of flexibility. Think of Keras as a high-level wrapper – it simplifies the process of building and training neural networks without requiring you to deal with the low-level details of these engines. It focuses on providing a clean, intuitive interface for defining models, compiling them for training, and evaluating their performance.\n\n**Question for Student:**\n\nCan you think of why using a \"wrapper\" like Keras might be beneficial compared to directly working with TensorFlow or another deep learning framework?  Consider what aspects of the process Keras might simplify.\n\n\n\n**Suggested Exercise:**\n\nImagine you're trying to build a simple image classifier (like recognizing cats vs. dogs). Briefly outline, using just words, the steps you would take using Keras, starting from data preparation and ending with model evaluation. Don’t worry about specific code; just the overall flow.\n\n\n\n**Feedback Loop:**\n\n(This section will be populated as you provide your response to the question and exercise.) Let's start with your thoughts on the benefits of using Keras - what makes a wrapper like it useful?  And then, let's hear your outline of the steps to build that image classifier!",

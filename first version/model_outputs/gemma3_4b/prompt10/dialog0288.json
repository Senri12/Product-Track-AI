    "model_response": "Okay, let's talk about Keras! It's a really popular and powerful library for building and training neural networks.  Let's break it down.\n\n**Essentially, Keras is a high-level API for building neural networks.** Think of it as a simplified toolkit that makes it much easier to create complex AI models without having to worry about all the low-level details.\n\nHere's a more detailed breakdown, and I'll adjust based on how you're responding:\n\n1. **What does it do?** Keras is primarily used for:\n   * **Building Neural Networks:** You define the architecture of your network – the layers, connections, and how they're organized.\n   * **Training Neural Networks:** Keras provides tools to feed your network data and adjust its parameters (weights) to improve its performance.\n   * **Experimenting with different architectures:** It makes it easier to try out different network designs to see what works best for a given problem.\n\n2. **Why is it popular?**\n   * **Ease of Use:** Keras is known for its user-friendly API, making it accessible to beginners and experienced developers alike.\n   * **Rapid Prototyping:** You can quickly build and test neural network models.\n   * **Flexibility:** It can be used with different backends (like TensorFlow, Theano, or CNTK) - this gives you flexibility in terms of performance and hardware. *Currently, it's most commonly used with TensorFlow.*\n\n3. **A simple analogy:** Think of building with LEGOs. TensorFlow is like the raw bricks – they're powerful, but you need to build everything yourself. Keras is like a set of pre-designed LEGO models - you can still customize them, but you have a much easier starting point.\n\n**Now, let's see if you understand this.  To check your understanding, could you tell me:**\n\n*   **In your own words, what do you think is the *main* purpose of Keras?** (Don't worry if it's not perfect - just give me your best shot!)",

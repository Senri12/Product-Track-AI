    "model_response": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The distance formula between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) in a coordinate plane is given by:\n\nDistance = √((x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²)\n\nLet's apply this to your points (1, 2) and (3, 4).\n\n1.  **Identify the coordinates:**\n    *   x1 = 1, y1 = 2\n    *   x2 = 3, y2 = 4\n\n2.  **Plug the values into the formula:**\n    Distance = √((3 - 1)² + (4 - 2)²)\n    Distance = √((2)² + (2)²)\n    Distance = √(4 + 4)\n    Distance = √8\n\n3.  **Simplify the radical (optional but recommended):**\n    √8 = √(4 * 2) = 2√2\n\nTherefore, the distance between (1, 2) and (3, 4) is 2√2.\n\n**Your Response:**  You correctly applied the distance formula!  Your calculations were accurate.\n\n**Feedback & Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Excellent:** You understood the formula and correctly applied it.\n*   **Simplification:** While your answer is correct, it’s good practice to simplify the radical.  Expressing the answer as 2√2 makes it a more standard form for Euclidean distance.\n*   **Clarity:** You could perhaps write out each step explicitly for clarity (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) etc.\n\n**Follow-up Questions:**\n\n1.  Can you explain in your own words *why* we square the differences in the x and y coordinates?  What does squaring do to the differences?\n2.  Let's say our points were (2, 5) and (6, 8). Calculate the distance between them.\n3.  Imagine you were plotting these points on a graph.  What would you need to do to find the distance between them?",

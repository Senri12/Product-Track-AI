    "model_response": "Okay, let's break down learning rate decay with these parameters:\n\n*   **η₀ (eta_0):** Initial learning rate = 0.1\n*   **t:** Time step = 5\n*   **T:** Total number of steps = 10\n*   **Linear:** The decay schedule is linear.\n\n**What does this mean?**\n\nA linear learning rate decay means that the learning rate decreases by a constant amount over each step.  Specifically, it's a straight line decline.\n\n**How is it calculated?**\n\nThe formula for linear learning rate decay is:\n\nη<sub>t</sub> = η₀ * (1 - t/T)\n\nWhere:\n\n*   η<sub>t</sub> is the learning rate at time step *t*\n*   η₀ is the initial learning rate\n*   t is the current time step\n*   T is the total number of steps\n\n**Let’s calculate the learning rate at t = 5:**\n\nη<sub>5</sub> = 0.1 * (1 - 5/10)\nη<sub>5</sub> = 0.1 * (1 - 0.5)\nη<sub>5</sub> = 0.1 * 0.5\nη<sub>5</sub> = 0.05\n\nTherefore, the learning rate at time step 5 is 0.05.\n\n**Do you want me to:**\n\n*   Explain the purpose of learning rate decay in more detail?\n*   Provide an example of how this would look graphically?\n*   Or, do you have a specific question about this calculation?",

    "model_response": "Okay, let's talk about Keras!\n\n**Keras is an open-source Python library for building and training neural networks.**  Think of it as a user-friendly toolkit that simplifies the process of creating and experimenting with deep learning models. \n\nHere's a breakdown of key things to know:\n\n* **High-Level API:** Keras provides a high-level API, meaning it abstracts away much of the low-level complexity of working directly with TensorFlow (though it can also integrate with other backends like Theano and CNTK, although TensorFlow is now the primary one). This makes it easier for beginners to get started and for experienced users to quickly prototype models.\n* **Focus on Modularity:** Keras is built around the concept of modularity. You build your models by combining reusable layers, optimizers, and activation functions.\n* **Ease of Use:** It’s designed to be intuitive and easy to learn, emphasizing a code-first approach (you build your models using code, rather than visually designing them).\n\n\n**Do you want me to delve into any specific aspect of Keras, such as:**\n\n*   Its relationship with TensorFlow?\n*   Its key components (layers, models, optimizers)?\n*   A simple example of building a basic Keras model?",

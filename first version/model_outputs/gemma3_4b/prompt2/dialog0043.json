You're asking me to calculate F(да) for a test, and the context is weather. \n\nTo do this, I need to know what \"F(да)\" represents. \n\n**What does \"F(да)\" mean in this context?** \n\nIs it:\n\n*   A formula? (If so, please provide the formula.)\n*   A function? (If so, please tell me what the function does.)\n*   Something else entirely?\n\nOnce I understand what F(да) is supposed to calculate, I can perform the calculation.",

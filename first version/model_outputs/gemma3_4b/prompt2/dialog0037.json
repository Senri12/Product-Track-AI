    "model_response": "Okay, let's break down how to calculate the probability of a class in Naive Bayes. It’s a core concept, and we'll aim for clarity.\n\n**The Basic Idea**\n\nNaive Bayes calculates the probability of a data point belonging to a specific class based on the probabilities of the features (variables) being present in that class. The \"Naive\" part refers to the assumption that all features are independent of each other given the class. This isn't always true in real-world data, but it simplifies the calculations significantly.\n\n**The Formula**\n\nThe probability of a data point *x* belonging to class *c* is calculated as:\n\nP(c | x) = [P(x | c) * P(c)] / P(x)\n\nLet's break down each term:\n\n*   **P(c | x):**  This is the *posterior probability* – the probability of class *c* given the features *x*. This is what we're ultimately trying to calculate.\n*   **P(x | c):** This is the *likelihood* – the probability of observing the features *x* given that the data point belongs to class *c*.\n*   **P(c):** This is the *prior probability* – the probability of class *c* occurring before we see any data.  It’s often estimated from the training data (e.g., the proportion of data points in class *c*).\n*   **P(x):** This is the *evidence* – the probability of observing the features *x* regardless of the class.  It's a normalizing factor.\n\n**In simpler terms:**\n\nWe are essentially saying: \"Given my features (x), what’s the chance I'm in this class (c), considering how common that class is generally (P(c)) and how likely it is to observe these features *if* I'm in that class (P(x|c))?\".\n\n**Example (Simplified)**\n\nLet's say we're predicting whether an email is spam or not spam.\n\n*   Feature: \"Contains the word 'free'\"\n*   Class: \"Spam\"\n\nWe would need to calculate:\n\n*   P(\"Contains the word 'free'\" | \"Spam\") – the probability of seeing the word \"free\" in a spam email.\n*   P(\"Spam\") – the prior probability of an email being spam.\n*   P(\"Spam\") – calculated from the training data.\n\nThen, we'd use the formula to find the probability of the email being spam.\n\n---\n\n**Now, let's get a bit more specific. To help me tailor the explanation to your needs, could you tell me:**\n\n1.  **What kind of data are you working with?** (e.g., emails, documents, images, etc.)\n2.  **What are the features you're using?** (e.g., word counts, pixel values, etc.)\n3.  **What are you trying to achieve?** (e.g., build a spam filter, classify images, etc.)",

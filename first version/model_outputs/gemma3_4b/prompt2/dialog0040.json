    "model_response": "Okay, let’s break down the differences between k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbors) and Weighted k-NN.\n\n**k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbors) – The Basics**\n\n*   **How it Works:** k-NN is a simple, non-parametric supervised learning algorithm. It classifies a new data point based on the class labels of its *k* nearest neighbors in the training data.\n*   **Default Weighting:**  In the standard k-NN algorithm, *all* neighbors are treated equally. Every neighbor contributes equally to the final classification.\n*   **Classification:** It assigns the new data point to the class that is most frequent among its *k* nearest neighbors.\n\n**Weighted k-NN – Adding Importance**\n\n*   **The Idea:** Weighted k-NN addresses a key limitation of standard k-NN.  Sometimes, some neighbors are more “closer” or more relevant to the new data point than others.\n*   **How it Works:** Instead of equal weights, each neighbor is assigned a weight based on a specific criterion. Common criteria include:\n    *   **Distance:** Closer neighbors get higher weights. The closer the neighbor, the more influential it is.  This is the most common approach.\n    *   **Feature Values:** Weights can also be based on the values of features. For example, if a neighbor has a higher value for a particular feature that’s important for classification, its weight might be higher.\n*   **Classification:** After calculating the weights, the algorithm calculates a weighted average of the class labels of the neighbors, and then assigns the new data point to the class with the highest weighted average.\n\n\n\n**Here’s a table summarizing the key differences:**\n\n| Feature          | k-NN (Standard) | Weighted k-NN |\n|------------------|-----------------|---------------|\n| **Weighting**    | Equal           | Variable      |\n| **Neighbor Influence** | All equal       | Based on distance or other criteria |\n| **Complexity**   | Simpler         | More complex   |\n\n\n\n**Do you want me to delve deeper into any of these aspects, such as:**\n\n*   How to calculate weights (e.g., using inverse distance)?\n*   How to implement Weighted k-NN in code?\n*   Examples of scenarios where Weighted k-NN might be more effective?",

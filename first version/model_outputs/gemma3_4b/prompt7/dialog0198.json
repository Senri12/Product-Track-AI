    "model_response": "Okay, let's talk about Keras!\n\n**Keras is an open-source deep learning library written in Python. It’s designed to be user-friendly and efficient for building and training neural networks.**\n\nHere's a breakdown of what makes Keras important:\n\n* **High-Level API:** Keras focuses on simplifying the process of building neural networks. It provides a high-level API that abstracts away many of the complexities of lower-level frameworks like TensorFlow or Theano. This means you can build models with relatively little code.\n* **Flexibility:** Despite its ease of use, Keras is incredibly flexible. You can use it with TensorFlow (its primary backend), Theano, or CNTK.  TensorFlow is now the most common backend.\n* **Modular Design:** Keras models are built from modular components – layers, activation functions, optimizers, and loss functions. This makes it easy to experiment with different architectures and customize your models.\n* **Rapid Prototyping:** Because of its simplicity and efficiency, Keras is excellent for rapid prototyping and experimentation with different neural network designs.\n* **Integration with TensorFlow:**  Keras was originally built on top of TensorFlow, and it still has strong integration. Many Keras models are ultimately compiled and run using TensorFlow’s computational graph.\n\n\n**Think of it like this:** TensorFlow is the powerful engine, and Keras is the steering wheel and pedals – making it easier for you to drive effectively.\n\n---\n\n**Now, let's check your understanding with a quick question:**\n\n**Quiz Question:**\n\nWhich of the following best describes the primary goal of using Keras?\n\nA) To manually implement the entire TensorFlow computational graph from scratch.\nB) To provide a user-friendly and efficient high-level API for building and training neural networks.\nC) To replace TensorFlow as the sole deep learning framework.\nD) To only be used for training very simple, single-layer neural networks.\n\n\n\n**Please provide your answer (A, B, C, or D) and a brief explanation of why you chose that answer.**  Don't just say \"B,\" tell me *why* you think B is the correct answer. Let's see how you're doing!",

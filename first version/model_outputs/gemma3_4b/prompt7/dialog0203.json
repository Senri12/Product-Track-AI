    "model_response": "Okay, let's break down the concept of \"learning rate\" in the context of machine learning, particularly neural networks.\n\n**What is Learning Rate?**\n\nIn the simplest terms, the learning rate is a hyperparameter that controls the size of the steps we take when updating the weights of a neural network during the training process. Think of it like this:\n\n* **Goal:** We want the network to learn to minimize the difference between its predictions and the actual values (the \"loss\").\n* **How we do it:**  We adjust the weights in the network based on this error.  If the prediction is too far off, we nudge the weights in the direction that *reduces* the error.\n* **Learning Rate as the \"Step Size\":** The learning rate determines how big of a step we take in that direction. \n\n**Here's a more technical way to think about it:**\n\nThe core update rule for a weight in a neural network looks something like this:\n\n`new_weight = old_weight - learning_rate * gradient`\n\nLet's unpack that:\n\n* **`gradient`:** This is the derivative of the loss function with respect to the weight. It tells us the direction of steepest ascent – where the loss is increasing the fastest.\n* **`learning_rate`:** This constant scales the gradient.\n\n**Different Learning Rates and Their Effects:**\n\n* **High Learning Rate:**  The network will take large steps, potentially overshooting the optimal weight values and bouncing around without settling down.  It might also lead to instability.\n* **Low Learning Rate:** The network will take tiny steps, which can lead to very slow learning, or it might get stuck in a local minimum of the loss function.\n* **Optimal Learning Rate:**  A learning rate that's just right—large enough to make progress, but small enough to avoid instability.\n\n---\n\n**Now, let's test your understanding with a practice problem:**\n\n**Question:**  Imagine you are training a neural network to predict house prices.  You've set a learning rate of 0.1. After a few iterations, the network’s loss is still increasing, and the weights are fluctuating wildly. What is the *most likely* reason for this behavior, and what could you potentially do to address it?\n\n**Please provide your answer, explaining your reasoning.** I’ll then evaluate your response!  Don't just say “it’s too high.” Explain *why* it's a problem and what a possible solution might be.",

    "model_response": "Okay, let's tackle that distance calculation!\n\n**Summary of Key Points:**\n\nThe lecture today covered the concept of the **Euclidean Distance** (also often called straight-line distance) between two points in a coordinate system.  Here’s the core idea:\n\n* **Coordinates:** We’re dealing with points represented by their coordinates (x, y) on a 2D plane.\n* **The Formula:** The Euclidean distance (d) between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n   d = √((x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²)\n\n* **What it Represents:** The formula essentially calculates the hypotenuse of a right triangle, where the legs are the difference in the x-coordinates and the difference in the y-coordinates.\n\n\n**Quiz Time!**\n\nLet's see if you've got it.\n\n**Question 1:**  Imagine you have two points:  A(2, 5) and B(7, 3).  What is the Euclidean distance between these two points? Show your work.\n(Give the student a moment to respond and calculate.)\n\n---\n\nOkay, let’s review the answer.  The correct calculation is:\n\nd = √((7 - 2)² + (3 - 5)²)\nd = √((5)² + (-2)²)\nd = √25 + 4\nd = √(29)\n\nTherefore, the Euclidean distance between points (2,5) and (7,3) is √(29).\n\n---\n\n**Let’s revisit the formula and the steps. Are there any parts of the formula or the calculation process that you found tricky?**\n\nFor example, are you comfortable with:\n\n*   **Squaring the differences:**  Why do we square (x2 - x1) and (y2 - y1)?\n*   **The Pythagorean Theorem:** Does the Pythagorean Theorem (a² + b² = c²) help you understand where this formula comes from?",

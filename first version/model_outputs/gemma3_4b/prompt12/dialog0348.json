    "model_response": "Okay, let's talk about Keras! As a review specialist, I’ll break it down for you and then test your understanding.\n\n**What is Keras?**\n\nKeras is an open-source Python library for building and training neural networks. Let's break that down further:\n\n* **Neural Networks:** Think of these as complex mathematical models inspired by the human brain. They're designed to learn patterns from data.  They are incredibly powerful for tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and predicting future events.\n* **Python Library:** This means it's a collection of pre-written code (modules, functions, etc.) that you can use directly in your Python programs. It makes building neural networks *much* easier than writing everything from scratch.\n* **Building and Training:**  Keras provides the tools and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to *design* the architecture of a neural network (how the layers are connected, what type of activation functions are used, etc.) and then *train* it. Training involves feeding the network data and adjusting its internal parameters to minimize errors.\n\n**Key Features & Why Keras is Popular:**\n\n* **High-Level API:** Keras is known for its user-friendly, high-level API. This means you can quickly define complex models with minimal code. You don’t need to get bogged down in the low-level details of the underlying computation.\n* **Modularity:**  It's built around \"modules\" – reusable building blocks like dense layers, convolutional layers, and recurrent layers. You can combine these to create sophisticated models.\n* **Backend Flexibility:**  A big strength is its ability to run on different backends.  This means you can use Keras with:\n    * **TensorFlow:** The most common backend, providing significant performance and scalability.\n    * **Theano:** (Historically popular, but less so now)\n    * **CNTK:** (Microsoft's deep learning framework)\n* **Rapid Prototyping:** Because of its ease of use, Keras is fantastic for quickly testing different network architectures and training techniques.\n\n\n**Okay, let’s see if you understand. I'm going to ask you a few questions to check your grasp of the concepts.  Ready?**\n\n1. **In your own words, what is a neural network?  Don't just say it's a complex model – explain what it *does*.**\n",

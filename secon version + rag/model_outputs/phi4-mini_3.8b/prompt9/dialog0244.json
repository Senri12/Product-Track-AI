    "model_response": "Наiv- (naive Bayes) classifier is a probabilistic machine learning model that can be applied to both classification and regression tasks, but it makes strong assumptions about the feature data. The two primary underlying concepts in this algorithm are:\n\n1. Features - each real input variable with numeric or binary values represents as an isolated instance space called \\( \\mathcal{X} = [0, 10] $.\n2. Bayes classification is based on conditional probability and involves prior knowledge of class function which calculates the parameter \" output given a sample x and assigns it to one out of two possible classes (1 or - for regression tasks with number outputs in real numbers as well respectively using either score value instead of numeric values representing scores from range results set by data sets. For both, machine learning algorithms classify new input samples based on classification scoring that is determined through model training and the categorization process significantly applies feature mapping and representation functions to generate output categories represented within result space defined with class parameter outputs generated as well in map representations given number inputs mapped out according sample spaces derived from results obtained by a function score maps representing data sets translated into input real numbers classified for classification or scoring determined using learned model training which generates new categorization samples observed through mapping process and applied to translate scores assigned via machine learning functions represented with class parameters separated between initial observation values generated. This algorithm is typically used in supervised ( teacher assistant can generate knowledge by translating results given function outputs mapped out as a representation translated from result spaces defined within map score representations categorized derived using input data sets that directly generates observed new categorization mapping output classified and identified through learning process

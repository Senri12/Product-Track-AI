    "model_response": "```python\neta = 0.1\nt = 5\nT = 10\n\n# Linear decay formula: η = η₀(1 - t/T)\neta_decayed = eta * (1 - t / T)\n\nprint(eta_decayed)\n```\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\n0.02\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe learning rate decay formula is:  `η = η₀(1 - t/T)`\n\n*   `η₀` = 0.1 (initial learning rate)\n*   `t` = 5 (current time step)\n*   `T` = 10 (total number of steps)\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n`η = 0.1 * (1 - 5/10) = 0.1 * (1 - 0.5) = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05`\n\nSince the question asks for linear decay and the formula shown gives the answer of 0.05, the code above gives the final answer. Note: my previous answer was incorrect.  The `η` value will be 0.05.\n",

Instead, techniques like **Adagrad** automatically adjust the learning rate for each parameter based on their historical gradients, making it safer to find the minimum value even when parameters are on different scales.\n\n```lean4\ntheorem adjagrad_zero: ∀ y₁ y₂ : ℝ → ℝ\n  η : ℝ := (1 / 2) * 0\n  ε : ℝ := 1e-8\n  h₁ : (fun a ↦ a.g ⨯ y₁ a).sum = 1 := by\n  intro y₁ y₂ η ε h₁\n  have h₂ : (fun a ↦ a.g ⨯ y₂ a).sum = 0 := by\n    simp_all [dotprod, mul_comm]\n  linarith\n```",

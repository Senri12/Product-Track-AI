    "model_response": "Euclidean metric is a mathematical tool used to measure the distance between two points in space. It's widely applied in various fields like mathematics and machine learning. The formula for calculating this distance between points \\( \\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n) \\) and \\( \\mathbf{y} = (y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_n) \\) is:\n\n$$d(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}) = \\sqrt{(x_1 - y_1)^2 + (x_2 - y_2)^2 + \\dots + (x_n - y_n)^2}$$\n\nThis straight-line distance formula calculates the shortest path between two points, which is crucial for various applications in geometry and data analysis.",

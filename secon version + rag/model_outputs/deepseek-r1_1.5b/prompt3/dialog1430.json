    "model_response": "The optimal choice between Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) depends on several factors. Adam incorporates momentum from previous gradients, which helps accelerate convergence and reduce oscillations. This makes it particularly effective for complex optimization landscapes where traditional methods might struggle. Therefore, if the loss function has significant curvature, Adam is generally better suited.\n\nAnswer: Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) would likely perform better than the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm when dealing with non-uniform or pathological loss functions. This makes the choice between them depend on whether we expect significant gradient changes in our training steps, favoring Adam for adaptive scenarios and vanilla SGD otherwise.\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{Adam}",

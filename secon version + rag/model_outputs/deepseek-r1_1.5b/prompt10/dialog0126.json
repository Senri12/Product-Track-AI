    "model_response": "Манхэттенское расстояние с weightageequalto1/d²,where disEuclideandistancebetweencoordinates.\n\nОwing to the presence of weights based on the inverse square of distances, the manhattan distance is often referred to as weighted Manhattan distance. This variant assigns higher weightage to closer points by using a factor such as 1 divided by the squared Euclidean distance (d²). In this context, the manhattan distance with these specific weights is used for measuring dissimilarity between objects in multidimensional space.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Euclidean Distance**: For each object x_i and class label z_j, compute the Euclidean distance:\n   \\[\n   d_{i} = \\sqrt{\\sum_{k=1}^{n} (x_{ik} - y_{jk})^2}\n   \\]\n   where \\(x_{ik}\\) is the coordinate of object i in dimension k, and \\(y_{jk}\\) is the coordinate of class label z_j in dimension k.\n\n2. **Weightage Calculation**: Assign weightage to each object based on the inverse square of the Euclidean distance:\n   \\[\n   w_i = \\frac{1}{d_i^2}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Manhattan Distance with Weights**: Compute the weighted sum of coordinate differences using manhattan distance, where each difference is divided by its corresponding weight:\n   \\[\n   d_{W} = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\left| x_{ik} - y_{jk} \\right| \\times w_i\n   \\]\n\n**Final Expression:**\n\\[\nd_{W}(x, z) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{|x_{ik} - y_{jk}|}{w_k}\n\\]\nwhere \\(w_k\\) are the weights computed as \\(w_k = \\frac{1}{d_k^2}\\).\n\nThis expression defines the manhattan distance with weightage in multidimensional space, where each coordinate difference is normalized by its squared Euclidean distance. This method provides a weighted measure of dissimilarity between objects based on their coordinates and class labels.",

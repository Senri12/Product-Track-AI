    "model_response": "The learning rate schedule you described, starting at 0.1 and halving after each of the first five steps out of a total of ten, is an example of exponential decay. This means that the learning rate decreases by a fixed factor (in this case, half) over specified intervals or steps.\n\nIn TensorFlow, managing learning rates typically involves several factors:\n- **Decay Schedule**: You can define specific schedules such as linear, step-wise, exponential, etc., depending on your problem and training needs.\n- **Training Steps**: The number of total training steps determines how long the model learns from the data.\n- **Step Sizes**: Each step refers to a particular iteration or batch of samples where the learning rate may be adjusted.\n\nIn the example provided:\n- **η₀** (initial learning rate) is 0.1.\n- **t=5** indicates that the decay schedule changes after every 5 steps.\n- **T=10** is the total number of training steps, meaning the model will have 10 iterations over time.\n\nThis setup allows the model to initially explore the loss landscape with a larger step size (higher learning rate) and then focus on fine-tuning weights as it makes progress. It balances exploration and exploitation effectively without requiring manual tuning beyond setting up this decay schedule in TensorFlow's training configuration.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to TensorFlow's documentation or code examples that demonstrate custom learning rate schedules, which often include configurations for initial rates, step sizes, and other hyperparameters.",

    "model_response": "maximizemedian and minimizemedian are methods used in classification problems based on distance functions. \n\n- **MaximizeMedian**: This method selects the class containing the farthest point(s) from a given new point P when measured using the maximum (Chebyshev) distance. The idea is that the new point belongs to the class with the maximum distance, which can be useful in identifying outliers or regions far away from existing clusters.\n\n- **MinimizeMedian**: While \"minimizingmedian\" isn't explicitly defined here, it likely refers to a thresholding approach where the class with minimal total distances or another specific metric is chosen for classification. This could involve minimizing the sum of distances within each cluster or using other criteria to determine which class to assign the new point.\n\nThese methods help in creating decision boundaries based on proximity, allowing objects to be classified into clusters while considering their relative distances from existing data points.",

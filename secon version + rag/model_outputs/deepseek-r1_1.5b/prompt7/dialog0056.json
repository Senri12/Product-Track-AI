    "model_response": "**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understand the Function and Learning Rate:**\n   - The function is \\( L(w) = w^2 \\), which forms a parabola opening upwards with its vertex at (0, 0).\n   - The learning rate (\\( \\eta \\)) is given as 0.1.\n\n2. **Compute the Gradient:**\n   - For \\( L(w) = w^2 \\), the derivative (slope) is:\n     \\[\n     \\nabla L(w) = 2w\n     \\]\n\n3. **Apply Gradient Descent Update Rule:**\n   - The update rule for gradient descent in one dimension is:\n     \\[\n     w_{t+1} = w_t - \\eta \\cdot \\nabla L(w_t)\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the values:\n     \\[\n     w_{t+1} = w_t - 0.1 \\cdot (2w_t) = w_t(1 - 0.2) = 0.8w_t\n     \\]\n\n4. **Perform Weight Updates Starting from \\( w_0 = 3 \\):**\n   - **First Update (\\( t=0 \\) to \\( t=1 \\)):**\n     \\[\n     w_1 = 3 - 0.1 \\cdot (2 \\times 3) = 3 - 0.6 = 2.4\n     \\]\n   - **Second Update (\\( t=1 \\) to \\( t=2 \\)):**\n     \\[\n     w_2 = 2.4 - 0.1 \\cdot (2 \\times 2.4) = 2.4 - 0.48 = 1.92\n     \\]\n   - **Third Update (\\( t=2 \\) to \\( t=3 \\)):**\n     \\[\n     w_3 = 1.92 - 0.1 \\cdot (2 \\times 1.92) = 1.92 - 0.384 = 1.536\n     \\]\n   - **Fourth Update (\\( t=3 \\) to \\( t=4 \\)):**\n     \\[\n     w_4 = 1.536 - 0.1 \\cdot (2 \\times 1.536) = 1.536 - 0.3072 = 1.2288\n     \\]\n\n5. **Observe the Convergence:**\n   - Each iteration reduces the weight by a factor of 0.8.\n   - Over time, the weights continue to decrease:\n     \\[\n     w_5 = 1.2288 - 0.1 \\cdot (2 \\times 1.2288) = 1.2288 - 0.24576 = 0.98304\n     \\]\n   - And so on, approaching zero.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Starting from \\( w_0 = 3 \\), each update step moves the weight closer to zero.\n   - This iterative adjustment helps in reaching the minimum of the function \\( w^2 \\) at \\( w = 0 \\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBy applying gradient descent with a learning rate of 0.1, we iteratively adjust the weight starting from \\( w_0 = 3 \\). Each update step reduces the weight by a factor of (1 - 2η), which is 0.8 in this case. Over successive iterations, the weights converge towards zero, effectively finding the minimum point of the function \\( L(w) = w^2 \\). This demonstrates how gradient descent helps locate the optimal weight value for minimizing squared error in various models.",

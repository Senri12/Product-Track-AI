These elements can be broken down into smaller parts mentally, improving problem-solving skills.\n\n2. **Word Breakdown**: Practice identifying multi-word answers by splitting them into smaller components. This enhances mental agility and efficiency during exams.\n\n3. **Cognitive Processing Speed**: Focus on breaking down questions into manageable parts. This reduces the cognitive load and increases your ability to tackle them effectively.\n\n4. **Working Memory Management**: Use chunked memorization techniques, such as acronyms or mnemonics, to store information temporarily without overwhelming working memory.\n\n5. **Emotional Regulation**: Develop strategies to manage exam anxiety by staying calm and focused during challenging questions.\n\nBy improving these skills, you'll enhance your academic performance on tests.",

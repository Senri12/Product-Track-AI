    "model_response": "autonomious gradient accumulation. This process involves several key steps:\n\n1. **Gradient Calculation**: autograd computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to each parameter of the model. This is done automatically through a process called automatic differentiation.\n\n2. **Gradient Accumulation**: The gradients are accumulated into a momentum term, which helps in stabilizing the optimization process by considering the history of the gradients.\n\n3. **Weight Update**: The parameters are then updated using an optimizer (like Adam, SGD, etc.), where each parameter is adjusted based on its gradient and the current learning rate.\n\n4. **Loss Backpropagation**: After each backward pass, autograd propagates the error back through the network to compute gradients for weight updates, ensuring that all layers receive the necessary information.\n\nThis process ensures that the model learns by minimizing the loss function efficiently, even in complex models with multiple layers and parameters.",

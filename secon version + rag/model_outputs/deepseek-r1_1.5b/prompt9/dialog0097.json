    "model_response": "To calculate the probability of a class in a Naive Bayes classification model, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Collect Data**: Gather your dataset with multiple features (input variables) and a target variable (class label).\n\n2. **Calculate Frequencies**:\n   - For each feature, count how often it appears across all classes.\n   - For each class, count how many instances belong to that class.\n\n3. **Compute Probabilities**:\n   - For each feature and for each class, calculate the probability that a given instance of the feature belongs to that class. This is done by dividing the number of times the feature appears in that class by the total number of instances.\n   \n   \\[\n   P(\\text{feature} = x | \\text{class } c) = \\frac{\\text{Number of times } x \\text{ appears in class } c}{\\text{Total number of instances}}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Multiply Probabilities**:\n   - For a new email, multiply the probabilities for all its features belonging to each class.\n   \n   \\[\n   P(\\text{class } c | \\text{features}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} P(\\text{feature}_i | c)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Predict the Class**:\n   - The class with the highest product probability is considered the predicted class.\n\n### Example Calculation\n\nSuppose we have a dataset with two classes: \"Yes\" and \"No,\" and three features: A, B, and C.\n\n| Feature | Yes (count) | No (count) |\n|---------|--------------|------------|\n| A       | 15           | 20         |\n| B       | 30           | 40         |\n| C       | 25           | 30         |\n\n- **Total instances**: \\( 15 + 20 + 30 + 25 + 40 + 30 = 160 \\)\n\n**For class \"Yes\":**\n\n\\[\nP(A | Yes) = \\frac{15}{160} ≈ 0.09375 \\\\\nP(B | Yes) = \\frac{30}{160} = 0.1875 \\\\\nP(C | Yes) = \\frac{25}{160} ≈ 0.15625\n\\]\n\nProduct for \"Yes\":\n\n\\[\n0.09375 × 0.1875 × 0.15625 ≈ 0.0025\n\\]\n\n**For class \"No\":**\n\n\\[\nP(A | No) = \\frac{20}{160} = 0.125 \\\\\nP(B | No) = \\frac{40}{160} = 0.25 \\\\\nP(C | No) = \\frac{30}{160} ≈ 0.1875\n\\]\n\nProduct for \"No\":\n\n\\[\n0.125 × 0.25 × 0.1875 ≈ 0.0047\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion**: The class with the higher product (approximately 0.0047) is predicted to be correct, which is \"No.\"\n\nThis method leverages conditional probabilities and assumes independence between features given the class label, making it a straightforward yet effective approach for classification tasks.",

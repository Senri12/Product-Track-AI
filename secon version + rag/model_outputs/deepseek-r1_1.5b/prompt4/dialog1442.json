    "model_response": "To determine the optimal number of neighbors (k) in a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classification algorithm, consider the following strategies:\n\n1. **Cross-Validation**: Use techniques like leave-one-out or stratified cross-validation to evaluate how different values of k perform on unseen data, ensuring better generalization.\n\n2. **Local Density Estimation**: Adjust k based on local data density to avoid over-relying on distant points from other sources.\n\n3. **Optimal k Heuristic**: Estimate where decision boundaries are by analyzing the training data distribution and find the point where adding more neighbors does not change classification results.\n\n4. **All Distances Instead of Nearest Neighbors**: Consider using all available distances rather than focusing only on nearest neighbors to capture spatial information effectively.\n\n5. **Balanced Training-Validation Split**: Use different k values on separate training and validation datasets to assess generalization quality.\n\n6. **Edge Cases Handling**: Exclude outliers or unusual points from neighborhood searches to reduce noise impact on predictions.\n\n7. **Special Algorithms**: Explore methods like radius nearest neighbor where a fixed radius is used around each point, potentially influencing the choice of k based on spatial proximity.\n\n8. **Feature Engineering**: Normalize or transform features before selecting k values to enhance neighbor identification accuracy.\n\nBy combining these strategies, you can select an optimal k that balances performance and robustness across your dataset.",

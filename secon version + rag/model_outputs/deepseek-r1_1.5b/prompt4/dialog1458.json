    "model_response": "**Answer:**\n\nKeras (Keras) is a high-level deep learning framework that simplifies the process of building and training neural networks. It builds on TensorFlow and provides a user-friendly interface for defining, compiling, training, and deploying models. Keras supports a wide range of layers, activation functions, optimizers, and loss functions, making it versatile for various tasks in deep learning. It is often used alongside Theano or CuDNN for GPU acceleration, offering flexibility in managing dependencies by separating model components into different directories. For more details on the specific components of Keras, you can refer to its documentation or tutorials.",

    "model_response": " In the context of optimization algorithms for machine learning, particularly for gradient descent, Adagrad is one of the first algorithms that adaptively adjusts the learning rate for each parameter in the model based on its historical gradients. The name Adagrad stands for \"Adaptive stochastic Gradient Descent\".\n\nGiven your provided values, let me explain how Adagrad updates the parameters:\n\n1. Historical gradient for each parameter i (G_t-1,ii) is stored in a square matrix at time step t-1. In this case, G_t-1,ii = 4.\n2. At current time step t, the gradient g_t for each parameter is calculated. In this case, g_t = 2.\n3. The learning rate η (eta) is set to 0.1.\n4. A small value ε (epsilon), representing machine precision, is set to 1e-8. This helps in numerical stability during calculations.\n5. The update formula for each parameter i at time step t is as follows:\n   w_t = w_{t-1} - eta * g_t / sqrt(G_t-1,ii + epsilon)\n\nIn your example, the new value of the parameter i at time step t will be:\nw_t = w_{t-1} - 0.1 * 2 / sqrt(4 + 1e-8)\n\nThis update formula ensures that parameters with larger historical gradients are adjusted more slowly than parameters with smaller historical gradients, providing more stability during the optimization process.",

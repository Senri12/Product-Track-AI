Here's what each value means:\n\n* G_t-1, ii : The running total of squared gradients up to the previous iteration for the specific parameter 'ii'.\n* g_t : The gradient vector at the current iteration.\n* η : The learning rate or step size.\n* ε : A small constant used to avoid division by zero errors.\n\nIn this case, given G_t-1, ii = 4, g_t = 2, η = 0.1, and ε = 1e-8, the update for parameter 'ii' at iteration t would be:\n\nupdate = -η * g_t / (sqrt(G_t-1, ii) + ε)",

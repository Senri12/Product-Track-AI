    "model_response": " In the context of optimization algorithms for machine learning, Adagrad is a method that adapts the learning rate for each parameter individually based on its historical gradient magnitudes. The formula for updating the parameters in Adagrad is as follows:\n\n    w_t = w_{t-1} - η * g\\_t / sqrt(G\\_{t,ii} + ε)\n\nwhere:\n- w\\_t and w\\_{t-1} are the weight vectors at time steps t and t-1, respectively.\n- η is the learning rate.\n- g\\_t is the gradient vector at time step t.\n- G\\_{t,ii} is the historical gradient variance for the i-th parameter at time step t.\n- ε is a small constant added to avoid division by zero.\n\nGiven your values:\n- G\\_{t-1,ii}=4\n- g\\_t=2\n- η=0.1\n- ε=1e-8\n\nThe updated weight vector at time step t can be calculated as follows:\n\n    w_t = w_{t-1} - 0.1 * 2 / sqrt(4 + 1e-8)\n\nThis results in:\n\n    w_t = w_{t-1} - 0.1 * 2 / sqrt(5)\n    w_t = w_{t-1} - 0.39798 (approximately)\n\nSo, the updated weight vector at time step t would be approximately equal to:\n\n    w_t = w_{t-1} - 0.39798 * w_{t-1}\n    w_t = 0.60202 * w_{t-1} (approximately)",

    "model_response": "Okay, let’s tackle this Nesterov update calculation. It looks like you've given me the key parameters: γ = 0.9, v = 1, and you've stated that we need to calculate ∇ in ω - γ v_{t-1}.\n\nFirst, let’s just make sure we understand what we're trying to do.  The Nesterov momentum update is a way to accelerate learning in a neural network. It uses a momentum term, which is essentially a moving average of past gradients.\n\n**My first question for you is: Can you remind me what the Nesterov momentum update equation *generally* looks like?  Don’t worry about plugging in the specific values just yet. Just give me the formula.**",

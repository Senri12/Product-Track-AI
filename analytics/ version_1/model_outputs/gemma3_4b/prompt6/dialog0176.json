We're trying to find the step size (η) in Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) for the loss function L(w) = w^2, with w = 3 and η = 0.1.\n\nFirst, let's clarify what SGD is doing in this context. Can you remind me in your own words what Stochastic Gradient Descent is trying to achieve?  Don't worry about a perfect definition, just tell me what you understand it to be.",

    "model_response": "Okay, let’s tackle learning rate decay! This is a really important concept when training neural networks – it helps them converge more quickly and avoid overshooting the optimal solution.\n\n**Concept: Linear Learning Rate Decay**\n\nIn linear learning rate decay, the learning rate decreases linearly over the training epochs.  We start with an initial learning rate (η₀) and then decrement it by a certain decay rate (often denoted as 'γ') for each epoch.  The formula is:\n\nη(t) = η₀ * (1 - (t/T))\n\nWhere:\n\n*   η(t) = Learning rate at time step *t*\n*   η₀ = Initial learning rate\n*   t = Current time step (or epoch number)\n*   T = Total number of epochs\n\nIn your case:\n\n*   η₀ = 0.1\n*   t = 5\n*   T = 10\n\nLet’s calculate the learning rate at time step 5.\n\nη(5) = 0.1 * (1 - (5/10)) = 0.1 * (1 - 0.5) = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05\n\nTherefore, the learning rate at time step 5 is 0.05.\n\n**Practice Problem/Quiz Question:**\n\nCalculate the learning rate at epoch 8, given η₀ = 0.1, t = 8, T = 10 and linear decay. Show your work!\n\n**Now, I’m waiting for your response.  Please provide your calculation for η(8).**  Take your time, and show me your work so I can understand your thinking. Let's see how you approach this!",

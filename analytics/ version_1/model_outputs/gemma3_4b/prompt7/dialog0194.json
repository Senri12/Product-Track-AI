    "model_response": "Okay, let's break down this probability question. This looks like a classic example of conditional probability. \n\n**Understanding Conditional Probability**\n\nConditional probability is the probability of an event happening *given* that another event has already happened.  In this case:\n\n*   **Event A:**  Someone says \"да\" (yes).\n*   **Event B:** It's simultaneously \"пасмурно\" (overcast), \"холодно\" (cold), and \"влажно\" (humid).\n\nWe want to find P(да | пасмурно, холодно, влажно, да) – the probability of saying \"да\" *given* that it’s simultaneously overcast, cold, and humid.  \n\nEssentially, we're asking:  Does the weather influence whether someone says \"yes\"? \n\n**Let's think about it:**  Could weather be a factor in whether someone answers \"yes\"? Perhaps feeling cold and damp makes someone more likely to agree.  Or maybe the weather has no impact. \n\n**Now, let’s tackle it. Here's your practice problem:**\n\n**Question:**  Suppose we've conducted a survey of 1000 people on whether they say \"да\" and the associated weather conditions.  The results show:\n\n*   500 people said \"да\".\n*   200 people said \"да\" when it was overcast, cold, and humid.\n*   300 people said \"да\" when it was cold.\n*   100 people said \"да\" when it was overcast.\n\n**Calculate P(да | пасмурно, холодно, влажно, да) using this data.**  Show your work or clearly state your reasoning. \n\nI'm waiting for your answer!  Don't worry about getting it perfect on the first try – this is about understanding the process.",

    "model_response": "Okay, let's calculate the learning rate decay using the given parameters:\n\n*   **η₀ (Initial Learning Rate):** 0.1\n*   **t (Current Time Step):** 5\n*   **T (Total Number of Time Steps):** 10\n*   **Linear Decay:** This means the learning rate decreases linearly over time.\n\n**Formula for Linear Decay:**\n\nη(t) = η₀ * (1 - t/T)\n\nWhere:\n\n*   η(t) is the learning rate at time t\n*   η₀ is the initial learning rate\n*   t is the current time step\n*   T is the total number of time steps\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nη(5) = 0.1 * (1 - 5/10)\nη(5) = 0.1 * (1 - 0.5)\nη(5) = 0.1 * 0.5\nη(5) = 0.05\n\n**Therefore, the learning rate at time step t=5 is 0.05.**\n\nDo you want me to calculate the learning rate at any other time step, or would you like me to explain the concept of learning rate decay in more detail?",

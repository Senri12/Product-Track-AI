    "model_response": "Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step.  I'll act as a review specialist, guiding you through the calculation and addressing any potential confusion.\n\n**Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe're dealing with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to minimize the cost function L(w) = w². We're given:\n\n*   **Cost Function:** L(w) = w²\n*   **Weight:** w = 3\n*   **Learning Rate:** η (eta) = 0.1\n\n**Calculating the Step**\n\nThe core idea of SGD is to update the weight 'w' based on the gradient of the cost function.\n\n1.  **Gradient:** The gradient of L(w) = w² is simply 2w.\n\n2.  **Update Rule:** The update rule for SGD is:  w<sub>new</sub> = w<sub>old</sub> - η * gradient\n\n3.  **Applying the Rule:**\n    *   w<sub>new</sub> = w<sub>old</sub> - η * (2w)\n    *   w<sub>new</sub> = 3 - 0.1 * (2 * 3)\n    *   w<sub>new</sub> = 3 - 0.1 * 6\n    *   w<sub>new</sub> = 3 - 0.6\n    *   w<sub>new</sub> = 2.4\n\n**Therefore, the step size (the change in w) for SGD in this case is 2.4.**\n\n---\n\n**Now, let's test your understanding with a quick quiz!**\n\n**Question 1:**\n\nConsider the cost function L(w) = w³.  If w = 2, η = 0.5, what is the single step size calculated using SGD? Show your work.\n\n**(Take a moment to answer this.  Think about the gradient and the update rule.)**\n---\n\nLet me know your answer to question 1, and we’ll move on to review any areas where you might be struggling!  Don't worry about getting it right the first time – this is all about learning.",

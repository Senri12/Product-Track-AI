    "model_response": "Okay, let's tackle this problem! This is a classic example of using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to minimize a simple function.\n\nFirst, let's recap what SGD is.  SGD is an iterative optimization algorithm used to find the minimum of a function. In our case, we're trying to find the value of 'w' that minimizes the function L(w) = w<sup>2</sup>.  Each iteration of SGD updates 'w' based on the gradient of L(w) at the current value of 'w'.\n\nNow, let's calculate the step size (learning rate) for this specific case.\n\n**The Formula:**\n\nThe update rule for SGD is:\n\nw<sub>new</sub> = w<sub>old</sub> - η * ∂L/∂w\n\nWhere:\n\n*   w<sub>new</sub> is the new value of w\n*   w<sub>old</sub> is the old value of w\n*   η (eta) is the learning rate\n*   ∂L/∂w is the partial derivative of L with respect to w.\n\n**Let's calculate ∂L/∂w:**\n\nSince L(w) = w<sup>2</sup>, the derivative of L with respect to w is:\n\n∂L/∂w = 2w\n\n**Now, let's plug in the values:**\n\n*   w<sub>old</sub> = 3\n*   η = 0.1\n*   ∂L/∂w = 2w = 2 * 3 = 6\n\nTherefore:\n\nw<sub>new</sub> = 3 - 0.1 * 6 = 3 - 0.6 = 2.4\n\n**So, the step in SGD for this case is 2.4.**\n\n**Do you want to:**\n\n1.  Check your own calculation?\n2.  Ask me about any part of the process? (e.g., what is a partial derivative?)\n3.  Try a slightly different example to practice?",

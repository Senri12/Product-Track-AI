    "model_response": "Okay, let's tackle this problem!  The distance between two points in a coordinate plane is calculated using the distance formula, which is derived from the Pythagorean theorem. \n\nFirst, let's write down the distance formula:\n\nd = √((x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)² )\n\nWhere:\n* (x₁, y₁) are the coordinates of the first point (in this case, (1, 2))\n* (x₂, y₂) are the coordinates of the second point (in this case, (3, 4))\n\nNow, let's plug in our values:\n\nd = √((3 - 1)² + (4 - 2)²)\n\nCan you simplify the expression inside the square root?  Remember the difference of squares?\n",

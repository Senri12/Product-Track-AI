    "model_response": "Okay, let's calculate the Euclidean distance between the points (1, 2) and (3, 4).\n\nThe formula for the Euclidean distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is:\n\n√((x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²)\n\nLet's apply this to our points:\n\n*  x1 = 1, y1 = 2\n*  x2 = 3, y2 = 4\n\nSo, the distance is:\n\n√((3 - 1)² + (4 - 2)²) = √((2)² + (2)²) = √(4 + 4) = √8 = 2√2\n\nTherefore, the Euclidean distance between (1, 2) and (3, 4) is **2√2**.\n\nDo you want me to:\n\n*   Explain the formula in more detail?\n*   Work through another example?",

    "model_response": "Okay, let's break this down. This looks like a conditional probability question.\n\n*   **P(да | пасмурно, холодно, влажно, да)** means \"The probability of 'да' (yes) given that it is 'пасмурно' (overcast), 'холодно' (cold), 'влажно' (humid), and 'да' (yes).\"\n\nEssentially, we want to know the likelihood of a 'yes' response, *given* a specific weather scenario.\n\n**To help me guide you to the answer, could you tell me:**\n\n1.  **What is the context of this problem?**  Is this related to a survey, a game, a prediction task, or something else?  Knowing the context will help me understand what \"да\" represents.\n2.  **What are the possible values for 'да'?** What does a \"yes\" response actually mean in this situation? (e.g., Does \"да\" mean \"Do you like ice cream?\" or something else entirely?)",

    "model_response": "Okay, let's tackle this problem! It's fantastic that you're working on this – understanding the distance formula is a really important foundation in geometry and algebra. Don't worry if it seems a little tricky at first; we'll break it down step-by-step.\n\n**What is the Distance Formula?**\n\nThe distance formula is a way to calculate the straight-line distance between two points on a coordinate plane.  Think of it like measuring the diagonal of a rectangle formed by those two points.\n\n**The Formula**\n\nThe distance (d) between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is calculated using this formula:\n\nd = √[(x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²]\n\nLet's break down what each part means:\n\n*   **x1, y1:** The coordinates of the first point.\n*   **x2, y2:** The coordinates of the second point.\n*   **√:** This is the square root symbol.  We need to find the square root of the final result.\n\n**Let’s Apply It to Your Problem: (1, 2) and (3, 4)**\n\n1.  **Identify the coordinates:**\n    *   (x1, y1) = (1, 2)\n    *   (x2, y2) = (3, 4)\n\n2.  **Substitute the values into the formula:**\n    d = √[(3 - 1)² + (4 - 2)²]\n\n3.  **Simplify:**\n    d = √[(2)² + (2)²]\n    d = √[4 + 4]\n    d = √8\n\n4.  **Calculate the square root:**\n    √8  ≈ 2.828\n\n**Therefore, the distance between the points (1, 2) and (3, 4) is approximately 2.828 units.**\n\n**Let's check your understanding:**\n\n*   **Think about it this way:**  Imagine drawing a right triangle. One leg is the difference in the x-coordinates (3-1 = 2), the other leg is the difference in the y-coordinates (4-2 = 2). The distance is the hypotenuse of that triangle. The Pythagorean Theorem (a² + b² = c²) is what's going on behind the scenes!\n\n**You’re doing great!** You’ve successfully navigated the distance formula. Do you want to try another example, or would you like me to explain the Pythagorean Theorem in more detail?  Perhaps you'd like to see another similar problem to build your confidence? Don't hesitate to ask any questions you have. I'm here to help you learn!  Keep up the excellent work!",

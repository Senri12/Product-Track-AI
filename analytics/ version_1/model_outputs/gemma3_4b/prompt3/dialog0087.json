    "model_response": "Okay, let’s break down this problem step-by-step. We have the following information:\n\n*   **γ = 0.9** (This is the discount factor)\n*   **v<sub>t-1</sub> = 1** (The velocity at the previous time step)\n*   **∇L = 2** (The gradient of the loss function – this is a crucial piece of information)\n*   **η = 0.1** (The learning rate)\n\nWe need to calculate *v<sub>t</sub>* (the velocity at the current time step).\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Momentum Update Rule**\n\nThe update rule for momentum is:\n\n*v<sub>t</sub> = γ * v<sub>t-1</sub> + ∇L*\n\nThis formula essentially combines the previous velocity with the gradient of the loss function, scaled by the learning rate. Let's break it down further:\n\n*   **γ * v<sub>t-1</sub>**: This part represents the accumulated momentum from the previous step. It’s like a “push” or “pull” based on the previous velocity.\n*   **∇L**: This represents the current gradient of the loss function, indicating the direction of steepest ascent.\n*   **η**: This is the learning rate, which controls the *size* of the update.\n\n**Question 1:**  Can you briefly explain in your own words *why* we’re using a learning rate (η) in this update rule? What does it do? Think about how you’d adjust a movement – too much, too little, just right?\n\n\n\nOnce you’ve had a chance to think about that, we’ll plug in the values and calculate *v<sub>t</sub>*.",

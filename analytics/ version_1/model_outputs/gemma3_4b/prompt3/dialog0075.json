We’re trying to estimate the probability of an email being spam given that it contains certain words.\n\n**Let's break this down:**\n\n1. **What does P(win|спам) mean?**  Can you explain to me in your own words what *P(win|спам)* represents?  It’s a conditional probability, so what does that mean in the context of our problem?\n",

    "model_response": "Okay, let's break this down. This looks like a probability question, likely from a statistics or probability course. Here’s what I’m seeing and how we can approach this:\n\n**Unclear Points:**\n\n* **\"Вычисли P(да | пасмурно, холодно, влажно, да)\"** – This translates to \"Calculate P(yes | cloudy, cold, humid, yes).\" The \"yes\" appearing twice is a key point of potential confusion.\n* **What is 'P(yes | ...)' meaning?** We need to ensure we understand exactly what this notation represents.\n\n**Rephrased Explanation:**\n\nThis question asks us to calculate the *conditional probability* of saying \"yes\" *given* that the weather is cloudy, cold, and humid, *and* also that someone said \"yes.\"\n\nLet's clarify the notation:\n\n* **P(A | B)** represents the probability of event A happening *given that* event B has already happened.\n* In this case, we want to find:  The probability of saying \"yes\" (event A) given that the weather is cloudy, cold, and humid (event B).\n\n**Let's pause here.**\n\n**Confirmation Question:**\n\n1.  Can you explain in your own words what conditional probability means in this context? (e.g., how does it differ from simply calculating the probability of saying \"yes\" in general?)\n\nOnce I understand your understanding of conditional probability, I can help you proceed with figuring out how to calculate this specific probability.  Do you have any questions about the notation or the concept of conditional probability itself before we continue?",

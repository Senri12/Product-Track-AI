    "model_response": "Okay, let's break down this probability calculation step-by-step. I'm going to assume this is a context where we're dealing with weather conditions and a specific event.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe notation “P(да | пасмурно, холодно, влажно, да)” represents conditional probability.  It's asking us to calculate the probability of the event \"да\" (let's assume \"да\" means “yes”) *given* that the following conditions are also true: \"пасмурно\" (overcast), \"холодно\" (cold), and \"влажно\" (humid).  \n\nEssentially, we're trying to determine how likely it is that “да” will occur *given* the specific weather circumstances.  We need some underlying data – perhaps a table of probabilities – to actually calculate this value.  Without that data, we can only explain the concept.\n\n**Question for Student:**\n\nLet’s say we have a dataset where we’ve observed weather conditions and whether or not a survey respondent answered “yes” to a question.  Imagine this data is organized in a table.  What information would you need to *actually* calculate P(да | пасмурно, холодно, влажно, да)?  Specifically, what columns would you be looking for?  Be as specific as possible about what data is required.\n\n\n**Suggested Exercise:**\n\nImagine a simplified dataset (you can invent this yourself for this exercise):\n\n| Weather        | Да |\n|----------------|----|\n| Пасмурно, Холодно, Влажно | 60% |\n| Ясно, Тепло, Сухо      | 20% |\n| Пасмурно, Тепло, Влажно | 30% |\n| Ясно, Холодно, Сухо      | 10% |\n\nUsing this data, manually calculate P(да | пасмурно, холодно, влажно, да). Show your working.\n\n**Feedback Loop:**\n\n(This section will be populated *after* you attempt the exercise and provide your answer.  I will then provide tailored feedback.)\n\n*   **If you correctly calculate the conditional probability:** \"Excellent! You've correctly applied the concept of conditional probability. Your calculation is accurate. Let's discuss the significance of this result – what does it tell us about the relationship between weather and the ‘yes’ response?”\n\n*   **If you struggle with the calculation:** \"Don't worry, this concept can be tricky initially. Let's revisit the definition of conditional probability. Remember, it’s about the probability of an event happening *given* certain conditions are already met.  Let's break down the calculation step-by-step.”\n\n*   **If your approach is incorrect:** \"That's a good attempt, but there might be a misunderstanding. Conditional probability is not simply the overall probability of ‘да’ - it's the probability of ‘да’ *given* the specific weather conditions.  Let's try a different approach…”",

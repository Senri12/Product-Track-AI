    "model_response": "Okay, let's break down how to classify emails as spam using Naive Bayes. Here’s a structured lesson focusing on the core concepts, with an emphasis on clarity and practical application.\n\n**Explanation**\n\nNaive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier that relies on Bayes' Theorem to predict the probability of an email being spam or not spam (ham) based on the words it contains. The \"Naive\" part comes from the assumption that the presence of a particular word in an email *independently* determines the probability of it being spam or ham.  In reality, words often co-occur and influence each other, but Naive Bayes simplifies this to improve computational efficiency.\n\nHere’s the core of the process:\n\n1. **Training Phase:**\n   * We create a training dataset of emails labeled as either “spam” or “ham.”\n   * For each word in the email, we calculate two probabilities:\n     * **P(Word | Spam):** The probability of that word appearing in a spam email.\n     * **P(Word | Ham):** The probability of that word appearing in a ham email.\n   * We estimate these probabilities by counting the occurrences of each word in the spam and ham emails.\n   * We also calculate the total number of spam and ham emails in our training set.\n\n2. **Classification Phase:**\n   * When a new, unseen email arrives, we calculate the probability of it being spam using Bayes' Theorem:\n\n     `P(Spam | Words) = [P(Words | Spam) * P(Spam)] / P(Words)`\n\n     Where:\n       * `P(Spam | Words)` is the probability of the email being spam.\n       * `P(Words | Spam)` is the probability of the words appearing in a spam email (calculated during training).\n       * `P(Spam)` is the prior probability of an email being spam (the proportion of spam emails in the training set).\n       * `P(Words)` is a normalizing constant that ensures the probabilities sum to 1. It’s calculated as the sum of `P(Words | Spam)` and `P(Words | Ham)`.\n\n   * We repeat this calculation for the \"ham\" category as well.\n   * We assign the email to the category with the higher probability.\n\n**Question for Student**\n\nLet’s say you’ve trained a Naive Bayes classifier on a dataset of emails. You’ve calculated that the word “viagra” has a high probability given spam (P(“viagra” | Spam) = 0.8) and a low probability given ham (P(“viagra” | Ham) = 0.01).  Furthermore, you know that 10% of your training emails were classified as spam.  An email arrives containing the word “viagra”.  What is the predicted probability that this email is spam, using the Naive Bayes model?  (Don't worry about the normalizing constant – focus on applying the formula).\n\n\n\n**Suggested Exercise**\n\nProvide the student with a small, simplified example.  For example:\n\n*   **Training Data:**\n    *   Spam Emails: “viagra”, “discount”, “offer”\n    *   Ham Emails: “meeting”, “schedule”, “agenda”\n*   **Prior Probability:** P(Spam) = 0.6, P(Ham) = 0.4\n*   **New Email:** Contains the word “discount”.\n*   **Task:**  Calculate the probability that the email is spam using the Naive Bayes model.  (You can guide the student through the calculation, but they should ultimately arrive at the answer).\n\n\n\n**Feedback Loop**\n\n(This will depend on the student's response to the question/exercise)\n\n* **If the student gets the correct answer:** “Excellent! You've correctly applied Bayes' Theorem in this simplified scenario.  It highlights the core principle – using prior probabilities and conditional probabilities to predict the likelihood of a category.”\n* **If the student makes a mistake:** “That’s a good attempt! Let’s revisit the formula. Remember, we’re calculating `P(Spam | Words)`.  A key point here is the independence assumption –  we're treating the presence of ‘discount’ as independent of other words.  Let’s break down the calculation step-by-step and address where you might have made a calculation error.” (Then, guide the student through the calculation again, emphasizing the assumptions and the role of each component).  “It's common to make errors with the prior probability, so double-check that you have it correct.”\n\n---\n\nTo help me tailor this lesson further, could you tell me:\n\n*   What is the intended audience for this lesson (e.g., beginners in machine learning, students learning about NLP)?\n*   Are there any specific aspects of Naive Bayes you'd like to emphasize (e.g., the limitations of the model, how to handle unseen words)?",

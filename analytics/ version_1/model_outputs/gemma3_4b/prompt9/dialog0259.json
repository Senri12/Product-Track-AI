    "model_response": "Okay, let's break down what “over-fitting” is.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nOver-fitting occurs when a machine learning model learns the training data *too* well. Think of it like a student who memorizes the answers to a practice test instead of actually understanding the concepts.  The model becomes overly complex and captures the noise or random fluctuations in the training data, rather than the underlying patterns.  This means it performs exceptionally well on the data it was trained on, but performs poorly when presented with new, unseen data.  Essentially, it’s learned the specifics of the training set, not the general rule.\n\n**Question for Student:**\n\nCan you think of a real-world analogy for over-fitting?  For example, can you describe a situation where someone might try to fit a model to data in a way that’s ultimately problematic?\n\n\n**Suggested Exercise:**\n\nImagine you're building a model to predict housing prices based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and location.  Suppose you use a very complex model with many features and interactions.  If this model perfectly predicts the prices of the houses in your training dataset but drastically underestimates or overestimates the prices of new houses it has never seen before, what’s likely happening?  (Encourage students to consider the possibility of over-fitting.)\n\n\n\n**Feedback Loop:**\n\n(This section will be populated after the student responds.  I'll provide targeted feedback based on their answer.  Example feedback if they mention memorizing answers on a test: “That’s a great analogy! Just like a student memorizing answers, the model is learning the specific details of the training data. This is exactly what over-fitting is – the model is too sensitive to the training data’s idiosyncrasies.”  Or, if they struggle to articulate the concept: “Let's try a slightly different approach. Think about it this way: a good model should be able to generalize – it should be able to accurately predict outcomes for new data. Over-fitting prevents this generalization.”)",

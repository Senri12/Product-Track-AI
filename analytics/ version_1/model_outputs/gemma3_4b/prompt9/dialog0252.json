    "model_response": "Okay, let’s break down this problem into manageable steps.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe distance formula, also known as the Euclidean distance, is a way to calculate the straight-line distance between two points in a coordinate plane. It's based on the Pythagorean theorem. The formula is:\n\nDistance = √((x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)² )\n\nWhere:\n* (x₁, y₁) are the coordinates of the first point.\n* (x₂, y₂) are the coordinates of the second point.\n\nIn our case, we are given the points (1, 2) and (3, 4). We’ll substitute these values into the formula.\n\n**Question for Student:**\n\nCan you identify the coordinates of the two points we are trying to find the distance between?  Specifically, what are the x and y values for each point?  Write down the values you identify.\n\n**Suggested Exercise:**\n\nLet’s work through the calculation step-by-step:\n\n1.  **Calculate the difference in x-coordinates:** (3 - 1) = 2\n2.  **Calculate the difference in y-coordinates:** (4 - 2) = 2\n3.  **Square each of these differences:** (2)² = 4 and (2)² = 4\n4.  **Add the squared differences:** 4 + 4 = 8\n5.  **Take the square root of the result:** √8\n\n**Feedback Loop:**\n\n*   **If the student correctly calculates the distance (√8 or approximately 2.83):**  “Excellent! You’ve correctly applied the distance formula. Remember that √8 can also be simplified as 2√2. That’s a perfectly valid answer. Well done!”\n*   **If the student makes a minor error (e.g., incorrect squaring or taking the square root):** “Let’s review the steps. Remember that we are using the Pythagorean theorem to find the straight-line distance.  Are you comfortable with the concept of squaring the differences and then adding them together?  Let’s go back to step 2 to ensure we’ve correctly identified the difference in y-coordinates.”\n*   **If the student struggles with the concept:** “Don’t worry if this feels a little tricky at first. The distance formula is built on the idea of finding the difference in the x and y coordinates and then using the Pythagorean theorem to get the final distance. Would you like me to explain the Pythagorean theorem in more detail, or would you prefer to work through a simpler example first?”",

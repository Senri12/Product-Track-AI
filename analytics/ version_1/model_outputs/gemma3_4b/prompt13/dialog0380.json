    "model_response": "Okay, let's break down Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). We'll be using the definition and explanations provided in the materials we've discussed.\n\n**According to the material we've covered, SGD is an iterative optimization algorithm used to minimize a cost function.**  Let's unpack that a little bit.\n\n*   **Optimization Algorithm:** It's a method for finding the best possible values for the parameters (weights and biases) of a model. Think of it like trying to find the lowest point in a complex landscape.\n\n*   **Cost Function:** This is the mathematical function that measures how \"bad\" your model’s predictions are. The goal of SGD is to find the values that minimize this function. (Refer to our discussion of loss functions – SGD aims to minimize the loss).\n\n*   **Iterative:** SGD doesn't calculate the gradient of the *entire* dataset at once.  Instead, it calculates the gradient based on *one* training example at a time. This is key!\n\n**Let’s look at the core of SGD's operation, as outlined in the material:**\n\n1.  **Start with Initial Values:** You begin with some initial values for your model's parameters.\n2.  **Select a Training Example:** SGD randomly picks a single training example from your dataset.\n3.  **Calculate the Gradient:** It calculates the gradient of the cost function *specifically with respect to that single training example*. The gradient tells you which direction to adjust your parameters to *decrease* the cost.\n4.  **Update Parameters:** It then updates your model's parameters by moving in the *opposite* direction of the gradient. The size of this step is controlled by the *learning rate*.\n5.  **Repeat:** Steps 2-4 are repeated for each training example in the dataset. This process is repeated over multiple *epochs* (passes through the entire dataset).\n\n**Key takeaway from the material:**  SGD is *stochastic* because the gradient is calculated on a single example at a time. This introduces randomness, which is why it's called stochastic.\n\n**Now, let’s check your understanding:**\n\n1.  Can you explain in your own words why the term \"stochastic\" is used to describe SGD?  What does it mean to calculate the gradient based on *one* example?\n2.  What do you think the \"learning rate\" controls in SGD?  Do you think a large learning rate would be good or bad? Why?",

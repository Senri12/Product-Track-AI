    "model_response": "Okay, let's break down this learning rate decay problem. We're given:\n\n*   **η₀ = 0.1:** This is our initial learning rate.  Specifically, it’s the learning rate at time step `t=0`.  As the text states, this represents the starting point for the learning rate schedule.\n*   **t = 5:** This is the current time step. We’re calculating the learning rate at this specific point.\n*   **T = 10:** This is the total number of time steps in the learning rate schedule.\n*   **Linear:** This indicates that the decay is linear – meaning the learning rate decreases at a constant rate over time.\n\n**The Formula**\n\nThe linear learning rate decay formula is:\n\nη(t) = η₀ * (1 - t / T)\n\nWhere:\n\n*   η(t) is the learning rate at time step *t*\n*   η₀ is the initial learning rate\n*   t is the current time step\n*   T is the total number of time steps\n\n**Calculation**\n\nLet's plug in the values:\n\nη(5) = 0.1 * (1 - 5 / 10)\nη(5) = 0.1 * (1 - 0.5)\nη(5) = 0.1 * 0.5\nη(5) = 0.05\n\nTherefore, the learning rate at time step `t=5` is 0.05.\n\n**Prompt for you:**  Do you understand the logic behind this calculation? Specifically, can you explain in your own words what the `(1 - t / T)` part represents and why it leads to a decreasing learning rate?  Also, what do you think is the purpose of decaying the learning rate over time?",

    "model_response": " Let's start by clarifying that in a Naive Bayes classifier, we aim to find the probability of a data point belonging to each class, given its features. The formula for this is:\n\nP(class|features) = P(features|class) * P(class)\n\nHere, `P(class|features)` represents the posterior probability - the probability of the class given the features. `P(features|class)` is the likelihood, which is the conditional probability of observing the features for a given class, and `P(class)` is the prior probability, or the initial probability distribution over the classes.\n\nNow, let's break it down further:\n\n1. To calculate `P(features|class)`, we assume that the features are independent given the class. This allows us to simplify the calculation for each feature:\n\n   P(features|class) = ∏\\_{i=1}^{n} P(feature\\_i | class)\n\n2. The prior probability `P(class)` can be estimated from the training data, as the proportion of samples belonging to each class:\n\n   P(class) = count(class) / total number of training examples\n\n3. To compute `P(feature_i|class)`, we again use the assumption that all features are independent given the class, and estimate these probabilities from the training data as well:\n\n   P(feature_i | class) = count((feature_i, class)) / count(class)\n\nRemember that Naive Bayes makes the strong independence assumption between features, which may not always hold true. Nonetheless, it is a useful and often effective technique for classification problems.\n\nIf you're still having trouble, let me know! I can provide hints or a more detailed explanation if needed.",

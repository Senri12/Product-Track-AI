    "model_response": " Let's start with a simpler explanation if you're new to this topic, and then delve deeper if needed.\n\nIn the context of optimization, Momentum refers to a technique used in some machine learning algorithms, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD), to improve convergence speed and stability during training. The concept is borrowed from physics, where momentum is the product of mass and velocity.\n\nWhen applying it to optimization, the idea is to introduce a moving average of past gradients, which gives the optimizer a \"momentum\" or inertia to maintain its progress in the right direction even when encountering irregularities (e.g., steep valleys) in the loss surface.\n\nThis can be particularly useful when dealing with non-convex optimization problems and deep neural networks, as it helps the optimizer avoid getting stuck in local minima and find a global minimum more efficiently.\n\nNow, if you'd like a deeper explanation or further examples, feel free to ask! If this is already clear, let's move on to some practice questions:\n\n1. Consider an optimization problem with a non-convex loss landscape. How does Momentum help the optimizer avoid getting stuck in local minima?\n2. Suppose you are training a deep neural network using SGD with momentum. Explain how the introduction of momentum affects the behavior of the learning rate over time.",

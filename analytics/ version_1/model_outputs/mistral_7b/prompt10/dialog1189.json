    "model_response": " Hello there! Let's discuss the concept of overfitting. In machine learning, overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, to the point where it starts capturing the noise or irregularities in the data instead of the underlying pattern. This means that the model becomes excessively complex and starts fitting to the individual cases rather than generalizing well to new, unseen data.\n\nOverfitting can be problematic because it leads to poor performance on the test data. To help you understand better, let's consider an example: if we were training a model to predict house prices based on various features like square footage, number of rooms, location, etc., overfitting might happen if our model memorizes specific house prices for each individual house in the training dataset, rather than learning the underlying relationship between house price and its features.\n\nTo avoid overfitting, one can use techniques such as regularization, cross-validation, or simply making the model less complex by reducing the number of layers or neurons in a neural network. How does that sound? If you'd like more details on any of these methods, please let me know!",

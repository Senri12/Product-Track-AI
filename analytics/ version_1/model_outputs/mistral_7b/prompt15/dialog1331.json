    "model_response": " To calculate the spam probability for the word 'приз', we would typically use a Naive Bayes Classifier or another machine learning algorithm trained on a dataset of spam and non-spam messages. However, since I don't have access to such a model, let's use a simplified approach based on some common characteristics of spam messages in Russian:\n\n1. Frequency of specific words: Spam messages often contain certain high-frequency words like 'офир', 'промокод', 'победа', and 'бонус'. The word 'приз' (prize) is not typically associated with spam, so its presence might lower the spam probability.\n\n2. Structure of the message: Spam messages often have a certain structure, such as excessive use of capital letters, multiple exclamation marks (!!!), numbers at the beginning of the message, and URLs. The example you provided doesn't show any clear signs of this structure, which suggests it might not be spam.\n\n3. Context: The context in which a word is used can also indicate whether a message is spam or not. In the given context, 'приз' is likely part of an announcement for a contest or giveaway, so it doesn't contribute to increasing the spam probability.\n\nBased on this simplified analysis, I would estimate the spam probability for the word 'приз' in the provided example as relatively low.\n\nImprovements: To make this more accurate, you should train a machine learning model using a larger and more diverse dataset of Russian spam and non-spam messages. This model would be able to take into account a wider range of features and better capture the nuances of Russian language spam detection.\n\nFollow-up questions: Could you provide more context for the message containing 'приз'? For example, is it part of an email, a social media post, or a text message? Also, are there any other words or patterns in the message that could potentially indicate spam?",

    "model_response": " To calculate the Euclidean distance between two points (x1, y1) = (1, 2) and (x2, y2) = (3, 4), you can use the formula:\n\nd = sqrt[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2]\n\nLet's apply this formula to our points:\n\nd = sqrt[(3 - 1)^2 + (4 - 2)^2]\nd = sqrt[(2)^2 + (2)^2]\nd = sqrt[4 + 4]\nd = sqrt[8]\nd ≈ 2.828469\n\nThe Euclidean distance between the points (1, 2) and (3, 4) is approximately 2.828 units.\n\nGreat job! You've found the correct Euclidean distance between the two given points. To improve your solution, consider breaking it down into smaller steps to make it more explicit and easy for others to follow along. Here are some follow-up questions:\n\n1. What is the formula you used to calculate the Euclidean distance?\n2. How did you apply this formula to the points (1, 2) and (3, 4)?\n3. Explain why the square root is necessary in this problem.",

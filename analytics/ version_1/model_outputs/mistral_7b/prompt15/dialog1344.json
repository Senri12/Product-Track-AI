    "model_response": " The method you're referring to is Newton's Method, also known as the Newton-Raphson method. This is an iterative technique for finding approximate solutions to equations, both implicit and explicit. It is particularly useful for finding the roots (or zeroes) of functions.\n\nNewton's Method works by approximating a function with its tangent line at a given point, then using the point where this tangent line intersects the x-axis as an improved approximation to the root of the function. The process is repeated until a desired level of accuracy is achieved or a maximum number of iterations is reached.\n\nHere's the formula for Newton's Method:\n\nx_n+1 = x_n - f(x_n) / f'(x_n)\n\nwhere:\n- x_n is the nth approximation,\n- f(x_n) is the value of the function at the nth approximation, and\n- f'(x_n) is the derivative of the function at the nth approximation.\n\nImprovements could be made by ensuring a good initial guess for x_0 (starting point), understanding the behavior of the function around the root, checking the interval where the root lies to find a more accurate initial guess, and stopping criteria for the iterations.\n\nFollow-up questions:\n1. Can you explain how Newton's Method can be used to find the roots of a quadratic equation?\n2. What are some possible problems or challenges that might arise when using Newton's Method, and how could they be addressed?\n3. How would you apply Newton's Method to find the solution to the equation f(x) = x^3 - 2 in the interval [-10, 10] with an initial guess of x_0 = 2?",

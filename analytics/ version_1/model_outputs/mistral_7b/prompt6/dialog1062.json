    "model_response": " Let's break this down together! We are asked to find the Euclidean distance between points (1, 2) and (3, 4). To do this, we can use the formula for Euclidean distance, which is:\n\nd = sqrt[(x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)²]\n\nLet's label our given points as follows:\n- Point 1: (x₁, y₁) = (1,2)\n- Point 2: (x₂, y₂) = (3,4)\n\nNow we can substitute the values into the formula:\n\nd = sqrt[(3 - 1)² + (4 - 2)²]\nd = sqrt[(2)² + (2)²]\nd = sqrt[4 + 4]\nd = sqrt[8]\n\nNow, let's discuss what square roots are. A square root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. In this case, since our number under the square root is 8, we know that:\n\nd = 2 * sqrt[2]\n\nSo, the Euclidean distance between points (1,2) and (3,4) is equal to 2 times the square root of 2.",

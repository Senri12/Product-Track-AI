    "model_response": " It appears that you are asking about what RMSProp is. RMSProp (Root Mean Square Propagation) is an optimization algorithm used primarily in machine learning and artificial neural networks for updating the weights during training.\n\nThe core idea of RMSProp is to adaptively adjust the learning rate by taking into account the moving average (root mean square) of the squared gradients. This helps to address the issue of varying learning rates across different parameters in a model, making the optimization process more efficient and stable.\n\nTo ensure I have understood your question correctly, could you please confirm if RMSProp is the optimization algorithm you were referring to? If not, let me know so that I can help clarify your query further.",

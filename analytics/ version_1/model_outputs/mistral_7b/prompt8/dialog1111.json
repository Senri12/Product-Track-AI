    "model_response": " To clarify, the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) is a machine learning algorithm that belongs to the instance-based learning category. This method is used for both classification and regression problems. The basic idea behind this technique is to classify an unknown data point based on the majority class of its 'k' nearest neighbors in the training dataset, where 'k' is user-defined.\n\nNow, I'd like to confirm my understanding: Is the method you are asking about, a machine learning algorithm that classifies or regresses an unknown data point using the majority class of its closest 'k' similar samples from a training set? Please let me know if my explanation needs further clarification.\n\nIf so, I can also explain the working principle and steps involved in implementing k-NN for classification and regression problems.",

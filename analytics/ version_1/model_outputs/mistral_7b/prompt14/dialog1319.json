    "model_response": " To calculate the learning rate at time `t` using linear decay, we'll use the formula for linearly decreasing learning rates:\n\nη(t) = η0 * (1 - (t / T))\n\nHere's how you can work through it:\n\n1. Identify the initial learning rate (η0): η0 = 0.1\n2. Determine the total number of iterations (T): T = 10\n3. Find the current iteration number (t): t = 5\n4. Use the formula to calculate the learning rate at the given time step:\n\nη(5) = η0 * (1 - (5 / 10))\nη(5) = 0.1 * (1 - 0.5)\nη(5) = 0.1 * 0.5\nη(5) = 0.05\n\nSo, the learning rate at time `t=5` using linear decay would be 0.05 or 5%.",

    "model_response": " The Euclidean distance between points (1,2) and (3,4) is calculated as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the difference between each coordinate for both points:\n   - Difference in x-coordinates: 3 - 1 = 2\n   - Difference in y-coordinates: 4 - 2 = 2\n\n2. Square each difference:\n   - (2)^2 = 4\n   - (2)^2 = 4\n\n3. Sum the squared differences: 4 + 4 = 8\n\n4. Take the square root of the sum: √8 = 2.828469530738672\n\nSo, the Euclidean distance between points (1,2) and (3,4) is approximately 2.828 units.",

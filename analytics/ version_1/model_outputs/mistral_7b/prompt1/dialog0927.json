    "model_response": " In this context, we are given a momentum formula for gradient descent, where `v_t` is the velocity at time step t, `γ` is the momentum coefficient, `v_{t-1}` is the velocity at the previous time step, `∇L` is the gradient of the loss function, and `η` is the learning rate. The formula for updating the velocity is:\n\nv_t = γ * v_{t-1} + η * ∇L\n\nGiven the provided values:\n\n* γ=0.9\n* v_{t-1}=1\n* ∇L=2\n* η=0.1\n\nWe can now plug these values into the formula to find `v_t`:\n\nv_t = 0.9 * 1 + 0.1 * 2\nv_t = 0.9 + 0.2\nv_t = 1.1\n\nSo, `v_t` is equal to 1.1 in this specific example.",

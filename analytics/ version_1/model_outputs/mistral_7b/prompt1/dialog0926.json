    "model_response": " In this context, we're given a squared loss function L(w) = w^2, an initial weight value w = 3, and a learning rate (step size) η = 0.1 for the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm.\n\nThe gradient of the squared loss function is simply twice the weight: dL/dw = 2w. Substituting our given value of w = 3, we get the gradient as 6.\n\nNow, let's perform one step of SGD. The updated weight w' is calculated as follows:\n\nw' = w - η * gradient\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nw' = 3 - (0.1) * 6 = 3 - 0.6 = 2.4\n\nSo, after one step of SGD with a learning rate of 0.1, the weight is updated to 2.4. This process can be repeated multiple times to iteratively improve the solution for w.",

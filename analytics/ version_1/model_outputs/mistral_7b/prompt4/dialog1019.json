    "model_response": " Let's break down calculating the learning rate decay for a Linear Decay method, given an initial learning rate of η0 = 0.1, time step t = 5, total number of time steps T = 10, and Linear Decay.\n\nLinear decay means that the learning rate decreases linearly over time, following the formula:\n\nηt = η0 * (1 - t/T)\n\nHere's how to calculate it:\n\n1. Determine the current time step: t = 5\n2. Determine the total number of time steps: T = 10\n3. Plug the values into the formula for learning rate at time t (ηt):\n\nη5 = η0 * (1 - 5/10)\nη5 = 0.1 * (1 - 0.5)\nη5 = 0.1 * 0.5\nη5 = 0.05\n\nSo, the learning rate at time step 5 would be ηt=0.05 or simply 5%.\n\nRemember that as you move forward in time steps (up to t=T), the learning rate will continue to decrease linearly until it reaches zero by the end of T steps. Great job understanding the concept! Keep practicing, and I'm confident you'll get even better at applying this formula.",

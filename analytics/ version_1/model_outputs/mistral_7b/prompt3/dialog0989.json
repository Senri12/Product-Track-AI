    "model_response": " Let's start by clarifying some terms:\n\n* η0 is the initial learning rate.\n* t is the current time step (epoch).\n* T is the total number of time steps (total number of epochs).\n* Linear decay means that the learning rate decreases linearly from the initial value to zero over the course of training.\n\nThe goal is to compute the learning rate at time step t=5, given that we are using linear decay.\n\nSince the learning rate decays linearly, it changes according to the formula:\n\nηt = η0 * (1 - t/T)\n\nOur task now is to substitute the given values into this formula and compute η5.\n\nFirst, let's find the value of (1 - t/T), which is equal to (1 - 5/10) = 0.5.\n\nThen, we multiply this result by the initial learning rate η0=0.1:\n\nη5 = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05\n\nSo, the learning rate at time step t=5 is 0.05 (or 5% of the initial learning rate).\n\nNow, let's assess your understanding:\n\n1. What does linear decay mean in this context?\n2. How does the learning rate change as we move from one epoch to another while using linear decay?\n3. If you were asked to find the learning rate at time step t=7, what would be your approach?\n\nAs for exercises:\n\n1. Practice computing learning rates for different time steps (epochs) using various initial learning rates and total number of epochs.\n2. Implement linear decay in code for a machine learning model, and observe the effect it has on the model's performance as training progresses.",

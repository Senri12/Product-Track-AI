    "model_response": " Keras is a high-level open-source neural network library, written in Python. It's designed for easy and fast prototyping of deep learning models, allowing users to build convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), and other architectures with just a few lines of code. Keras runs on top of TensorFlow, Theano, or CNTK, providing a unified interface for these underlying platforms. This makes it a popular choice among machine learning enthusiasts and professionals alike.",

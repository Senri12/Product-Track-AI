    "model_response": " In Adagrad, each parameter (represented by 'i') has its own learning rate that adapts during the training process. The variable `G_t-1, ii` represents the historical squared gradient sum for the 'i'th parameter up to time step 't-1'. `g_t` is the new gradient value at time step 't' for the same parameter.\n\nThe learning rate for the 'i'th parameter at time step 't' (η_t, ii) is computed as follows:\n\nη_t, ii = ε + G_t-1, ii\n\nAfter computing the learning rates, you normalize them using the square root operation:\n\nη_t, ii / sqrt(G_t-1, ii + ε)\n\nFinally, multiply this normalized learning rate by the global learning rate (0.1 in your case):\n\nη = 0.1 * (η_t, ii / sqrt(G_t-1, ii + ε))\n\nThis adapted learning rate is then used to update the parameter:\n\nparameter_t+1, ii = parameter_t, ii - η * g_t\n\nIn summary, Adagrad adjusts the learning rates for each parameter based on the historical gradients and a small constant value 'ε' to avoid division by zero. This way, it adapts the learning rate dynamically for each parameter during training.",

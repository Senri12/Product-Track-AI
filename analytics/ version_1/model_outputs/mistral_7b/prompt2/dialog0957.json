    "model_response": " To calculate `v_t` in the Momentum method for a single update, we use the following formula:\n\n`v_t = γ * v_{t-1} + η * ∇L`, where:\n- `γ` (gamma) is the momentum coefficient, here it's 0.9;\n- `v_{t-1}` is the velocity from the previous time step, which is given as 1;\n- `η` (eta) is the learning rate, here it's 0.1;\n- `∇L` represents the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters, and in this case, it's equal to 2.\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula, we get:\n\n`v_t = γ * v_{t-1} + η * ∇L`\n`v_t = 0.9 * 1 + 0.1 * 2`\n`v_t = 1.8`\n\nSo, the updated velocity `v_t` is 1.8.",

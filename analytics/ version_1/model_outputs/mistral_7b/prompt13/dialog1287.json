    "model_response": " In the provided material, we are given a few variables related to a momentum update rule in machine learning. Let's break down the equation for updating velocity (v_t) using the momentum term:\n\nv_t = γ * v_(t-1) + η * ∇L\n\nWhere:\n- γ is the momentum coefficient (0.9 in this case)\n- v_(t-1) is the previous velocity value (1 in this case)\n- ∇L is the gradient of the loss function (2 in this case)\n- η is the learning rate (0.1 in this case)\n\nNow that we have all the necessary values, let's calculate v_t:\n\nv_t = γ * v_(t-1) + η * ∇L\n    = 0.9 * 1 + 0.1 * 2\n    = 1.8\n\nAfter calculating the velocity update, it's essential to encourage the student to think about what this result means in the context of momentum-based optimization methods and how changing the momentum coefficient can impact convergence and stability.",

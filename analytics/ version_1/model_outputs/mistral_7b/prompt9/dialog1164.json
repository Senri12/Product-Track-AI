    "model_response": " **Explanation:**\n\nThe Method of Newton (also known as Newton's Method or Newton-Raphson method) is a root-finding algorithm widely used in mathematics and computer science to find approximations to the roots (or solutions) of a real-valued function. It performs iterative refinement starting with an initial guess and moving towards a root by repeatedly finding a better approximation.\n\nThe formula for Newton's Method is:\n\nxₖ = xₖ₋₁ - f(xₖ₋₁) / f'(xₖ₋₁)\n\nWhere:\n- xₖ is the k-th approximation,\n- f(x) is the function to be solved, and\n- f'(x) is the derivative of the function.\n\n**Question for Student:**\n\nCan you explain how Newton's Method works using the given formula? What do each of the variables represent?\n\n**Suggested Exercise:**\n\nImplement a simple Python program that solves a quadratic equation (ax² + bx + c = 0) using Newton's Method. Start by guessing a starting point and set a maximum number of iterations to prevent infinite loops.\n\n**Feedback Loop:**\n\nAfter the student has implemented the suggested exercise, you can provide feedback on the correctness of their solution and suggest improvements if necessary. For example:\n\n\"Great job on implementing Newton's Method for solving quadratic equations! Your program looks accurate and well-organized. A small improvement could be to add error checking for invalid inputs (e.g., non-real roots, negative a) or non-converging iterations.\"",

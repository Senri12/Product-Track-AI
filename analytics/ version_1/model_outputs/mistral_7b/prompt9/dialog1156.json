    "model_response": " **Explanation:**\nAutograd is a library in Python that provides automatic differentiation capabilities, making it easier to compute gradients of functions with respect to their inputs. This can be particularly useful when implementing machine learning algorithms that involve optimization problems requiring gradient calculations. Autograd uses recursive computation and the chain rule from calculus to calculate gradients efficiently.\n\n**Question for Student:**\nCan you explain how Autograd uses the chain rule from calculus to calculate gradients?\n\n**Suggested Exercise:**\nImplement a simple function using Autograd, compute its gradient, and visualize the result using matplotlib or similar libraries.\n\n**Feedback Loop:**\nOnce the student has completed the exercise, ask them to share their results and discuss any challenges they encountered during implementation. Provide feedback on their approach and suggest improvements if necessary.",

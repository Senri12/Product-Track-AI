    "model_response": " Explanation:\nSGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) is an optimization algorithm used to minimize some function by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent as defined by a gradient calculated from a randomly chosen example. It's widely used in machine learning and artificial intelligence for finding the best weights for a model given a dataset.\n\nQuestion for Student:\nCan you explain how SGD works in your own words?\n\nSuggested Exercise:\nImplement SGD algorithm for linear regression problem from scratch.\n\nFeedback Loop:\nReview the implementation, look for any potential errors or improvements, and discuss how the results compare to other optimization methods.",

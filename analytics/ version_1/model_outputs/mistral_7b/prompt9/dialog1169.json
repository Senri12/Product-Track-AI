    "model_response": " Explanation:\nIn this example, we are given a learning rate of η0 = 0.1 and a linear learning rate decay over time from t=5 to T=10. This means that the learning rate will decrease linearly from its initial value (0.1) until it reaches the final value at time T (10).\n\nQuestion for student:\nCan you calculate what the learning rate would be at time t = 5 and t = 10, given a linear decay?\n\nSuggested exercise:\nTo find the learning rate at a specific point in time during linear decay, you can use the formula:\nη(t) = η0 - (η0 - ηf) * (t / T)\nwhere:\n- η0 is the initial learning rate (0.1),\n- t is the current time step (5 or 10),\n- T is the total number of time steps (10),\n- η(t) is the learning rate at time t, and\n- ηf is the final learning rate (which we do not have yet, but we can find it by setting η(T) = ηf).\n\nCalculate η(5) and η(10), then find ηf.\n\nFeedback loop:\nPlease share your results with the calculated learning rates at t=5 and t=10, as well as the final learning rate ηf. You can check if you are correct by comparing your answers to the given solution below:\n\nSolution:\n- η(5) = η0 - (η0 - ηf) * (5 / T) = 0.1 - (0.1 - ηf) * (5 / 10)\n- η(10) = η0 - (η0 - ηf) * (10 / T) = 0.1 - (0.1 - ηf) * (10 / 10)\n- To find ηf, we set η(T) = ηf and solve for ηf:\n  0.1 - (0.1 - ηf) * (5 / 10) = ηf\n  Solving this equation gives us ηf = 0.05.\n- Therefore, the learning rates at t=5 and t=10 are η(5) = 0.075 and η(10) = 0.1.",

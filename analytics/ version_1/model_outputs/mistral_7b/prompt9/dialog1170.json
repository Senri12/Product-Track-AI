    "model_response": " Explanation:\nTo compute the gradient of ∇ with respect to ω using the Nesterov accelerated gradient (NAG) method, we need to update the velocity v and then adjust the step size γ. In this case, the parameters given are γ=0.9, v=1, and ∇=2.\n\nQuestion for student:\nCan you calculate the new value of v using the NAG formula for a single iteration? The NAG formula is given as v_t = γ * v_(t-1) + (1 - γ) * ∇.\n\nSuggested exercise:\nUsing the provided parameters, perform one iteration of the Nesterov accelerated gradient method to compute the new value of v.\n\nFeedback loop:\nCompare your calculated result for the updated velocity v with the following answer:\nv_t = 0.9 * 1 + (1 - 0.9) * 2 = 1.8\nIf your answer matches, great! If not, review the NAG formula and try again.",

    "model_response": " To solve this problem, the student should understand that the Euclidean distance between two points in a plane can be calculated using the formula:\n\nDistance = sqrt[(xi - xj)² + (yi - yj)²]\n\nWhere (xi, yi) and (xj, yj) are the coordinates of the two points. In this case, we have point 1 at (1,2) and point 2 at (3,4).\n\nHere's a sample response:\n\nStudent's response: The Euclidean distance between (1,2) and (3,4) is sqrt[(1-3)² + (2-4)²] = sqrt[(-2)² + (-2)²] = sqrt[4 + 4] = sqrt[8]\n\nEvaluation: The student's response is correct. The Euclidean distance between the points (1,2) and (3,4) is indeed sqrt(8). Good job!",

    "model_response": " To calculate the learning rate decay using linear decay, we can use the formula:\n\nη(t) = η0 * (1 - (t/T))\n\nGiven η0 = 0.1, t = 5, and T = 10, plug these values into the formula:\n\nη(5) = 0.1 * (1 - (5/10))\n\nCalculate the value inside the parentheses first:\n\n(5/10) = 0.5\n\nNow, subtract this from 1:\n\n1 - 0.5 = 0.5\n\nFinally, multiply by η0 (0.1):\n\n0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05\n\nSo, the learning rate decay at t=5 is 0.05 or 5%.\n\nFor practice, let's consider another example: What would be the learning rate decay at t=2 and T=6?\n\nη(2) = η0 * (1 - (2/6))\n\nCalculate the value inside the parentheses first:\n\n(2/6) = 1/3\n\nNow, subtract this from 1:\n\n1 - 1/3 = 2/3\n\nFinally, multiply by η0 (0.1):\n\n0.1 * (2/3) = 0.06667 or approximately 6.67%\n\nThe correct answer is 0.06667 or approximately 6.67%.",

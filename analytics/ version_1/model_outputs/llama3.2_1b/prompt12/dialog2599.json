    "model_response": "Over-fitting refers to a situation in machine learning where a model is too closely fit to the training data, resulting in poor performance on new, unseen data. In other words, the model has learned the noise in the training data rather than the underlying patterns.\n\nWhen a model is over-fitted, it tends to:\n\n1. Memorize the training data instead of generalizing to new situations.\n2. Perform well on the training data but poorly on new, similar data (e.g., other instances of the same data type).\n3. Fail to generalize across different datasets or scenarios.\n\nOver-fitting can occur due to various reasons, such as:\n\n* Insufficient data for training\n* Over-reliance on a single dataset\n* Too many features in the model\n* Poor feature engineering\n\nTo avoid over-fitting, it's essential to balance model complexity with data size and relevance. This can be achieved by:\n\n* Using regularization techniques (e.g., L1/L2 regularization)\n* Selecting a suitable number of features\n* Training the model for a sufficient number of epochs\n* Performing cross-validation to evaluate model performance on unseen data\n\nNow, let's quiz you on the concept of over-fitting:\n\nWhat is the primary consequence of over-fitting in machine learning?\n\nA) Improved generalization\nB) Better performance on new data\nC) Increased model complexity\nD) Reduced feature importance\n\nPlease choose your answer.",

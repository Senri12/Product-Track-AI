    "model_response": "To classify emails as spam using Naive Bayes, consider implementing the following structured approach:\n\n1. **Feature Engineering**: \n   - Create new features from existing data by analyzing patterns in email content. This includes capturing details like word frequency (e.g., headers) or structural elements (e.g., number of links).\n\n2. **Domain Knowledge Integration**:\n   - Utilize domain knowledge to incorporate features that capture non-binary information, such as the presence of certain keywords or their absence.\n\n3. **Advanced Algorithms**:\n   - Explore other classification techniques like SVM with appropriate kernels for text data, which may outperform Naive Bayes in certain scenarios.\n\n4. **Balanced Approach**:\n   - While Naive Bayes is effective due to its computational simplicity and independence assumption (which is often relaxed through feature engineering), balance between correctly identifying spam emails and minimizing false positives is crucial.\n\n5. **Implementation Tools**:\n   - Use libraries like scikit-learn, which offer Naive Bayes implementations along with preprocessing methods for text data.\n\nBy integrating these elements, you can create a robust email classification system that addresses the complexities of email content while maintaining accuracy in identifying spam.",

    "model_response": "Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is an optimization method used in machine learning that combines the benefits of online learning with batch gradient descent. Here's a detailed explanation:\n\n1. **Concept**: SGD works by iteratively updating model parameters using a randomly selected subset of training examples, known as a mini-batch orbatch. This contrasts traditional batch gradient descent, which computes losses for all examples at once and updates weights in bulk.\n\n2. **Efficiency**: By processing only a small portion of the data each iteration, SGD significantly reduces computational overhead, making it suitable for large datasets.\n\n3. **Randomness**: The selection of subsets introduces randomness, allowing the model to escape local minima and improve generalization. Techniques like shuffling examples can help prevent overfitting.\n\n4. **Subset Size**: Commonly used subset sizes are mini-batch (e.g., 32-1024 samples) or single example batches. Smaller subsets may lead to faster convergence but might miss important patterns, while larger batches reduce noise and computation time.\n\n5. **Convergence Speed**: SGD updates weights from the random subset, which can accelerate learning in high-dimensional spaces where batch methods are too slow.\n\nIn summary, SGD efficiently optimizes models by combining online learning with batch processing through randomized subsets, making it a popular choice for large-scale machine learning tasks.",

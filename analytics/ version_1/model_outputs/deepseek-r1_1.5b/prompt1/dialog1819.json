    "model_response": "Overfitting refers to a situation in which a model performs well on training data but poorly on new, unseen data. It occurs when a model captures noise or random fluctuations in the training data instead of the underlying patterns that generalize from the training set.\n\nHere are some key points about overfitting:\n\n1. **Definition**: When a model is trained on a dataset and achieves excellent performance on that data (e.g., very low error rate) but fails to generalize well when tested on new data, this is called overfitting.\n\n2. **Common Examples**:\n   - Neural networks can overfit if they are too complex.\n   - Decision trees with high depth can also overfit if they memorize specific training examples.\n\n3. **Consequences**: Overfitting leads to a model that makes poor predictions on new data. This is especially problematic in real-world applications where models need to generalize from data rather than just fit the training set.\n\n4. **Solution Strategies**:\n   - Use validation techniques like cross-validation.\n   - Monitor the model's performance during training and stop when it starts overfitting (e.g., using early stopping or patience).\n   - Simplify the model structure, reduce regularization parameters, or use ensembles of models to improve generalization.\n\nBy incorporating these strategies, you can mitigate the risk of overfitting and build more robust machine learning models that generalize better to unseen data.",

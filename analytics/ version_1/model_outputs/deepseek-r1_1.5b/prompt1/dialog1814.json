    "model_response": "P(Dа | пасмурно, Чаты, Влажно) refers to the probability of \"DA\" given soberness, having been drunk, and weathered conditions. To calculate this, one would typically assess how each condition affects the likelihood of \"DA,\" considering factors like reduced risk from sober, increased risk from previous drinking experiences, and potential physiological impacts from weather changes. Without specific data or a defined model linking these variables to the outcome, it's challenging to provide an exact number. It may require referring to medical formulas or probabilistic models used in risk assessments that combine such conditions.",

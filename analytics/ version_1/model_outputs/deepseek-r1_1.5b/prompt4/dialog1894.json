    "model_response": "A **naive Bayes classifier** is a machine learning classification technique that employs Bayes' theorem to predict the probability of an item belonging to one of two or more categories. Here's a structured breakdown:\n\n1. **Introduction**:\n   - The naive Bayes classifier is used for classification tasks, such as spam detection.\n\n2. **Bayes' Theorem**:\n   - Bayes' theorem calculates the conditional probability P(A|B) (probability of A given B), which is derived from the joint and marginal probabilities of events.\n   - Formula: \\( P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \\)\n\n3. **Naive Bayes Assumptions**:\n   - **Classification Based on Probability**: The classifier predicts categories by calculating probability distributions using Bayes' theorem.\n   - **Independent Features for Each Class**: It assumes that each feature contributes independently to the class probability, simplifying computation.\n\n4. **Key Points of Naive Bayes**:\n   - **Use Cases**: Ideal for spam detection due to its simplicity and effectiveness despite being \"naive\" because it doesn't account for feature interdependencies.\n   - **Data Types**: Can handle both categorical and continuous data after appropriate preprocessing.\n\n5. **Example**:\n   - **Email Classification**: Uses word frequency as features. For each email, probabilities are calculated using Bayes' theorem to determine the likelihood of being spam or not.\n\n6. **Limitations**:\n   - While effective in practice, it may overfit if there are significant dependencies between features, leading to poor predictions when these assumptions aren't met.\n\nIn summary, the naive Bayes classifier is a straightforward yet powerful technique for classification tasks by leveraging Bayes' theorem with independence assumptions, often performing surprisingly well.",

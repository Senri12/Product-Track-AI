    "model_response": "To calculate F(eda) using weather data, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Data Collection**: Gather cloud cover percentage data from at least two relevant months, ensuring consistent measurement (e.g., same time each month).\n\n2. **Average Calculation**: Compute the average of the collected percentages.\n\n3. **F(eda) Conversion**: Multiply the average percentage by 10 to convert it into a score. This gives F(eda), which reflects public belief in climate change arguments.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\n\n- March and April (20 days total).\n- Cloud cover percentages averaged at 58%.\n- Convert to F(eda): 58 × 10 = 580.\n\n**Considerations:**\n\n- **Data Consistency**: Ensure consistent measurements across months and within each month.\n- **Validity and Reliability**: Validate the measure against other indicators, consult with experts on similar metrics, and consider local variations.\n- **Comparison**: Compare F(eda) with established scores to assess its reliability. Consider using additional methods for more accurate results.\n\nThis method provides a structured approach, but further refinement based on data quality and comparison is recommended.",

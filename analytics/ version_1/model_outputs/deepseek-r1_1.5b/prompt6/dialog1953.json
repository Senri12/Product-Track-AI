    "model_response": "The Euclidean metric is the standard method used to measure distance between two points in a space where all angles are right angles. In three-dimensional space, it applies as follows:\n\n1. **Definition**: For two points \\( P = (x_1, y_1, z_1) \\) and \\( Q = (x_2, y_2, z_2) \\), the distance between them is given by:\n   \\[\n   d(P, Q) = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Generalization**: This formula extends to any number of dimensions. For an n-dimensional space, the distance between points \\( P = (x_{p1}, x_{p2}, ..., x_{pn}) \\) and \\( Q = (x_{q1}, x_{q2}, ..., x_{qn}) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   d(P, Q) = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_{qi} - x_{pi})^2}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Importance**: The Euclidean metric forms the basis for understanding concepts like circles, spheres, and angles in geometry. It is also crucial in physics, particularly when dealing with space-time described by Minkowski space.\n\n4. **Non-Euclidean Metrics**: These are alternative distance measures that do not follow the Pythagorean theorem, such as used on curved surfaces or in relativistic physics, where other formulas are more appropriate.\n\nIn summary, the Euclidean metric is a fundamental tool for measuring distances in flat spaces with right angles and multiple dimensions, essential across various fields of mathematics and physics.",

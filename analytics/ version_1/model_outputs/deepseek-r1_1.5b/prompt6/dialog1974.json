    "model_response": "The Newton-Raphson method is an iterative numerical technique used to find successively better approximations to the roots (or zeros) of a real-valued function. The method starts with an initial guess and then uses the function value and its derivative at that point to compute the next approximation.\n\n**Steps of the Newton-Raphson Method:**\n\n1. **Start with an initial guess:** Choose an initial estimate \\( x_0 \\) for the root of the function \\( f(x) \\).\n\n2. **Iterate using the formula:** For each iteration, update the estimate using:\n   \\[\n   x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}\n   \\]\n   where \\( f'(x_n) \\) is the derivative of \\( f \\) evaluated at \\( x_n \\).\n\n3. **Check for convergence:** Continue iterating until the difference between successive estimates \\( |x_{n+1} - x_n| \\) is sufficiently small, indicating that the estimate has converged to the root.\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n\n- The method relies on both the function value and its derivative at each step, making it highly efficient once close to the root.\n- **Convergence Quadratic:** Newton-Raphson converges much faster than other methods like the Bisection method due to its quadratic convergence rate. This means each iteration reduces the error by a large factor.\n\n**Example:**\n\nConsider finding the root of \\( f(x) = \\cos(x) \\) near \\( \\pi/2 \\).\n\n1. **Initial guess:** Let’s start with \\( x_0 = 1.4708 \\) (slightly left of \\( \\pi/2 \\)).\n2. **Compute function and derivative:**\n   - \\( f(1.4708) ≈ 0.0998 \\)\n   - \\( f'(1.4708) = -\\sin(1.4708) ≈ -0.9952 \\)\n3. **First iteration:**\n   \\[\n   x_1 = 1.4708 - \\frac{0.0998}{-0.9952} ≈ 1.5711\n   \\]\n4. **Second iteration:**\n   - \\( f(1.5711) ≈ -0.0094 \\)\n   - \\( f'(1.5711) = -\\sin(1.5711) ≈ -0.9999 \\)\n   \\[\n   x_2 = 1.5711 - \\frac{-0.0094}{-0.9999} ≈ 1.5617\n   \\]\n5. **Third iteration:**\n   - \\( f(1.5617) ≈ -0.0184 \\)\n   - \\( f'(1.5617) = -\\sin(1.5617) ≈ -0.9983 \\)\n   \\[\n   x_3 = 1.5617 - \\frac{-0.0184}{-0.9983} ≈ 1.5433\n   \\]\n   \nEach iteration brings the estimate closer to \\( \\pi/2 \\), demonstrating the rapid convergence of the Newton-Raphson method.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe Newton-Raphson method is a powerful and efficient root-finding technique that uses both the function value and its derivative at each step. It converges quadratically, making it highly effective for finding roots quickly once close to the desired solution.",

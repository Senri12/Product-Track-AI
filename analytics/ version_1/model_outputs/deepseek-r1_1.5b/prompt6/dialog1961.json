    "model_response": "To calculate the probability of spam for the word \"приз,\" we consider it as a typo for \"prize.\" We use statistical methods based on email content and keyword frequency to estimate spam likelihood. Here's a concise summary:\n\n1. **Keyword Frequency Analysis**: Look at how often words like \"prize\" appear in emails flagged as spam.\n2. **Research Resources**: Explore studies that correlate word frequencies with spam detection rates.\n3. **Statistical Models**: Develop or use existing models (like Naive Bayes) to predict email spam based on content patterns.\n\nThis approach provides a foundation for estimating the probability, leveraging data from past emails and known spam indicators.",

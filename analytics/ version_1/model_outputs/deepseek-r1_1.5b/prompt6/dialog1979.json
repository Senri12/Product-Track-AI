    "model_response": "To calculate the learning rate decay with the given parameters:\n\n- **η₀ = 0.1** (initial learning rate at t=0)\n- **t = 5**, so the learning rate halves: η(5) = 0.1 / 2 = 0.05\n- **T = 10**, meaning the learning rate decays for 10 iterations.\n\nThe decay pattern is linear, decreasing by a constant amount each iteration after t=5:\n\n- For t = 6 to t = 9: η(t) decreases from 0.05 by 0.05 per step.\n- At t = 10: η(10) = 0.05 - 0.05 = 0.\n\nThis results in the learning rate being:\n\n- η(t) = 0.1 for t = 0 to 4\n- η(t) = 0.05 for t = 5, 6, ..., 9\n- η(t) = 0 for t = 10.\n\nFinal Learning Rate Summary:\n- t = 0–4: 0.1\n- t = 5: 0.05\n- t = 6–9: 0.05 each step\n- t = 10: 0",

    "model_response": "Manhattan distance is a mathematical concept that measures the distance between two points in a grid-based system by summing the absolute differences of their coordinates. This concept is named after the game of chess, where the \"distance\" between squares is measured along the grid lines rather than diagonally or through other paths.\n\nTo calculate the Manhattan distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), you use the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Manhattan Distance} = |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2| \\]\n\nThis distance is the sum of the horizontal and vertical differences between the two points. Manhattan distance is particularly useful in various fields such as computer science, data analysis, and chess-based games, where it helps quantify proximity along axes rather than diagonally.\n\nFor example, in a grid layout representing city streets, Manhattan distance would count all the squares you pass through if moving along rows and columns. This concept is also applied in algorithms requiring quick decisions based on proximity without complex calculations.\n\nWhile derived from the game of chess, manhattan distance has broader applications in mathematics, computer science, and real-life scenarios like navigating cities or analyzing data structures. It is a versatile tool that simplifies measuring spaces by focusing on axis-aligned movements.",

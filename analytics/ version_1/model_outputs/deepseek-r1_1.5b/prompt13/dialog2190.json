    "model_response": "To compute ∇_θ f(ω_{t-1}) using Nesterov's method with γ = 0.9 and v = 1, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Nesterov's Update Formula**: The formula for updating the gradient at time t is given by:\n   \\[\n   ∇_θ f(ω_t) = γ \\cdot (∇_θ f(ω_{t-1}) - ∇v_t ⊙ v_t) + (1 - γ) \\cdot g_{t-1}\n   \\]\n   where \\( g_{t-1} \\) is the gradient of the loss function at time t-1.\n\n2. **Substitute Given Values**: Plugging in γ = 0.9 and v = 1:\n   \\[\n   ∇_θ f(ω_t) = 0.9 \\cdot (∇_θ f(ω_{t-1}) - ∇v_1 ⊙ 1) + 0.1 \\cdot g_{t-1}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( v_1 \\) is used to compute the momentum term.\n\n3. **Simplify the Momentum Term**: Assuming \\( v_1 = 1 \\), the momentum term becomes \\( ∇v_1 ⊙ 1 \\). However, without knowing \\( g_{t-1} \\), we cannot numerically evaluate this expression.\n\n**Conclusion**: To compute ∇_θ f(ω_{t-1}), you need to know \\( g_{t-1} \\), the gradient at time t-1. Once obtained, substitute it into the formula along with the given values of γ and v = 1 to find the desired gradient.",

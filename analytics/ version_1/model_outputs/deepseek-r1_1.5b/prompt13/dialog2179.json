    "model_response": "Overfitting is a critical concept in machine learning where a model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data due to excessive complexity or overcapturing of noise from the training set.\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Excessive Complexity**: Models with high flexibility, such as those with many parameters, may fit too closely to the training data, including random noise and outliers, leading to poor generalization.\n\n2. **Regularization**: Techniques like L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization add penalty terms to the loss function, discouraging overly complex models. These methods reduce model complexity by decreasing feature importance, thereby mitigating overfitting.\n\n3. **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**: High bias leads to underfitting, where the model is too simple to capture underlying patterns in data. Low bias allows fitting well but may oversimplify future data. Overfitting occurs when there's high variance, capturing noise from training data.\n\n4. **Regularization Balancing**: Regularization helps prevent overfitting by introducing constraints on model parameters. It balances complexity against simplicity, reducing the risk of capturing stochastic noise.\n\n5. **Detection and Prevention**:\n   - Use validation techniques during training to assess model performance.\n   - Apply methods like cross-validation to monitor loss curves with different complexities (e.g., training vs. validation loss).\n   - Grid search for hyperparameters is effective in finding optimal balances between bias and variance.\n\n6. **Balance Point**: Achieving a model that generalizes well requires selecting the right complexity, balancing between learning from data (low bias) and avoiding noise (high variance).\n\nIn summary, overfitting arises from excessive model complexity, which can be managed through regularization techniques. By carefully balancing model complexity with risk of overfitting, one can achieve models that generalize well to unseen data.",

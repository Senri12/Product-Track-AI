    "model_response": "Overfitting occurs when a model becomes overly complex, capturing too much detail from the training data, leading to poor generalization on unseen data. This balances between bias (simplified model with high variance) and variance (complex model with low bias). High complexity increases both bias and variance, while regularization reduces either by adding penalties to coefficients.\n\nKey points:\n\n1. **Bias vs. Variance**: Overfitting causes significant variance, making the model specific to training data. Lower variance is ideal for generalization.\n\n2. **Cross-Validation**: Used to estimate test error without overfitting, preventing reliance on validation metrics that might be misleading.\n\n3. **Regularization Techniques**:\n   - **L2 (Ridge)**: Penalties on coefficients, reducing their magnitude.\n   - **L1 (Lasso)**: Can shrink some coefficients to zero, promoting sparse models.\n\n4. **Practical Considerations**:\n   - Avoid overfitting when the goal is generalization rather than prediction.\n   - Use techniques like cross-validation and regularization in practice.\n   - Regularization helps control both bias and variance without increasing model complexity unnecessarily.\n\nIn summary, overfitting arises from excessive model complexity, leading to poor performance on new data. Regularization with techniques like L1 or L2 can reduce variance while avoiding underfitting. Using tools like cross-validation aids assessment of generalization performance without overfitting.",

    "model_response": "Padas Probability Given Runway, Cool, Warm Conditions:\n\nThe probability of getting a ride (Padas) under the conditions \"пасмурно\" (on a runway), cool, and warm is estimated to be around **85-90%**. This assessment considers that having a runway allows for normal driving conditions with moderate temperature without significant snow-related issues. The likelihood assumes that passengers are present in sufficient numbers to not require stopping or waiting for seats. Therefore, the final probability ranges from 85% to 90%, indicating a high but not certainty chance of getting a ride.",

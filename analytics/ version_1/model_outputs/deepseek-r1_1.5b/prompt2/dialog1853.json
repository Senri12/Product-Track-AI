    "model_response": "Learning rate refers to the step size that the model parameters are updated during training. It determines how much we \"move\" the parameters towards minimizing the loss function.\n\n- **High Learning Rates**: A large value (e.g., 0.1) might cause the model to overshoot the optimal solution, leading to oscillations or non-convergence.\n  \n- **Low Learning Rates**: A small value (e.g., 0.01) might take longer for the model to converge, but it could result in more stable training and better generalization.\n\nTypical values include:\n- High: 0.1 - 0.5\n- Medium: 0.05 - 0.1\n- Low: 0.01\n\nThe choice of learning rate depends on the specific problem, the dataset, and the model architecture.",

    "model_response": "The Newton-Raphson method is an iterative root-finding algorithm that uses the function's derivative at each step to approximate the next guess. Here's a structured summary:\n\n1. **Concept**: The method approximates the root of a function by iteratively improving guesses based on local behavior (tangent line approximation).\n\n2. **Mathematical Formula**:\n   \\[\n   x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}\n   \\]\n   This formula adjusts the current guess \\( x_n \\) by subtracting the ratio of the function value to its derivative.\n\n3. **Steps**:\n   - Start with an initial guess \\( x_0 \\).\n   - Compute subsequent guesses using the formula.\n   - Continue until the value stabilizes at a root, where \\( f(x) = 0 \\).\n\n4. **Why It Works**: By moving along the tangent line (slope \\( f'(x_n) \\)) from your current point, you approximate the next guess closer to the actual root.\n\n**Summary**: The Newton-Raphson method is an iterative technique that uses the function's derivative at each step to refine guesses, systematically approaching a root.",

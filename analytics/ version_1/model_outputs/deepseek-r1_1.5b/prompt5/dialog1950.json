    "model_response": "The problem involves computing the gradient using Nesterov's accelerated gradient method. Here's the step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify Parameters**:\n   - Momentum (gamma, γ) = 0.9\n   - Velocity (v) = 1\n   - Gradient (∇) = 2\n\n2. **Apply Nesterov Accelerated Gradient Formula**:\n   The formula for updating the velocity involves a combination of the current gradient and a scaled past gradient:\n   \\[\n   v_{t+1} = γ \\cdot v_t + (∇ F(x_t + β \\cdot v_t))\n   \\]\n   where \\(β\\) is typically 0.9, but in this case, we're given gamma directly.\n\n3. **Compute the Gradient**:\n   Using the provided values and the formula:\n   \\[\n   ∇ = γ \\cdot (∇ \\text{ from previous step}) + (∇ F(x))\n   \\]\n   Since v is already given, it's used as a starting point for the computation.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   The gradient of 2 is computed by applying Nesterov's method with gamma=0.9 and velocity=1 to the current gradient estimate.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{∇ = 2}",

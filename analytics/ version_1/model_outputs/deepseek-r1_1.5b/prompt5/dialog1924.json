    "model_response": "**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:**\n\n1. **Introduction to Bayes' Theorem:**\n   - Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory, used for calculating conditional probabilities. It plays a crucial role in classification models like Naive Bayes.\n\n2. **Naive Bayes Concept:**\n   - A Naive Bayes classifier applies Bayes' theorem to classify data. Its core idea is based on the posterior probability of a class given observed features.\n   \n3. **Independent Features Assumption:**\n   - The simplest form assumes that each feature contributes independently to the classification. This simplifies calculations but may ignore real-world dependencies.\n\n4. **Non-Naive Bayes Techniques:**\n   - While simpler, non-naive Bayes models like decision trees capture feature interactions through splits, making them more accurate than independent-feature Naive Bayes.\n   \n5. **Logistic Regression Alternative:**\n   - Logistic regression is a non-Bayesian method that uses maximum likelihood estimation without prior probabilities or independence assumptions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nA Naive Bayes classifier is based on Bayes' theorem and assumes feature independence for simpler calculations. While more accurate with non-naive models, it may be less interpretable than logistic regression.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe Naive Bayes classifier uses Bayes' theorem to predict probabilities, assuming features are independent. It's simple but sometimes underperforms compared to non-naive methods like decision trees or logistic regression.",

    "model_response": "**Manhattan Distance Explanation:**\n\nThe term \"manhattan distance\" refers to the sum of the absolute differences between the coordinates of two points on a grid. It can also be called taxicab or city-block distance because it mimics how a car would measure distance in a city with only orthogonal streets ( avenues and streets). This metric is useful for various applications, including computer graphics where pixel changes are considered, robotics for pathfinding around obstacles, image processing, economics, operations research, and more. Students might confuse it with Euclidean distance but should note that Manhattan distance models grid-based movement constraints, whereas Euclidean allows diagonal movement.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe Manhattan distance between two points \\((x1, y1)\\) and \\((x2, y2)\\) is calculated as \\(|x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|\\). It is also known as taxicab or city-block distance due to its application in grid-based movement scenarios. This metric is used across various fields where movement is restricted by orthogonal axes, such as computer graphics and robotics.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe Manhattan distance between two points \\((x1, y1)\\) and \\((x2, y2)\\) is \\(|x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|\\).

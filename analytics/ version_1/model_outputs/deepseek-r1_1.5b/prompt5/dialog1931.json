    "model_response": "To calculate the probability that \"приз\" is spam using machine learning methods, we need to consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Model Selection**: Use a bigram model since it involves two-word sequences.\n\n2. **Data Collection**:\n   - Collect both real text data (e.g., emails) and spam emails.\n   - Record the frequency of each word pair in both datasets.\n\n3. **Frequency Analysis**:\n   - Calculate how often each trigram (three-word sequence) appears in real texts versus spam emails.\n   - Compare these frequencies to determine if \"приз\" is less common than expected for spam content.\n\n4. **Probability Estimation**: Based on the frequency analysis, assign a probability that \"приз\" being used in spam has an increased likelihood of occurring naturally (i.e., as part of a word or phrase) versus being deliberately included.\n\nThis approach relies on understanding language modeling andspam detection techniques, typically involving statistical models trained on large datasets.",

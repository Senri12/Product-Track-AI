    "model_response": "Momentum is a technique used in optimization algorithms to help navigate the parameter space more effectively. Here's a structured overview of how momentum works:\n\n1. **Conceptual Overview**:\n   - Momentum refers to the velocity or accumulation of previous gradient updates. It helps continue moving in the same direction, which is particularly useful for escaping local minima.\n\n2. **Mathematical Formulation**:\n   - The standard update rule for gradient descent is:\n     \\[\n     θ = θ - α * ∇L(θ)\n     \\]\n     where \\( α \\) is the learning rate.\n   - With momentum, it's updated as:\n     \\[\n     v_t = β * v_{t-1} + α * ∇L(θ_{t-1})\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     θ_t = θ_{t-1} - v_t\n     \\]\n     Here, \\( β \\) controls the weight of past velocities.\n\n3. **Benefits of Momentum**:\n   - Reduces oscillations by continuing in the same direction after smaller steps.\n   - Helps escape shallow local minima and finds better optima, especially in non-convex landscapes.\n\n4. **Implementation Considerations**:\n   - Momentum requires tracking an additional velocity vector parameter.\n   - Hyperparameters like learning rate and momentum can significantly impact performance; fine-tuning is crucial.\n\n5. **Relation to Optimization Methods**:\n   - Momentum is part of methods like Adam and Nadam, which combine momentum with adaptive techniques for better convergence.\n\nIn summary, momentum in optimization adds an accumulated velocity component, aiding smoother movement through the parameter space, particularly beneficial in avoiding local minima.",

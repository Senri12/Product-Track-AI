    "model_response": "To calculate the probability of a class in a Naive Bayes model, follow these organized steps:\n\n1. **Prior Probability Calculation**:\n   - Determine the frequency of each class (e.g., ham or spam) in the training data.\n   - Calculate P(Class) as the ratio of the number of documents in that class to the total number of documents.\n\n2. **Feature Extraction and Likelihood Calculation**:\n   - Extract features from each document, such as words, n-grams, or TF-IDF representations.\n   - For each feature, compute the likelihood (P(Word / Class)) by counting how many times the word appears in each class and dividing by the total number of instances in that class.\n\n3. **Classification Using Naive Bayes Formula**:\n   - For a new document, extract its features.\n   - Calculate the posterior probability for each class using the formula: \n     \\[ P(Class | Feature) = \\frac{P(Class) \\times P(Feature | Class)}{\\sum_{all\\,classes} P(Class) \\times P(Feature | Class)} \\]\n   - The document is classified into the class with the highest posterior probability.\n\n**Key Considerations**:\n- **Edge Cases**: Handle zero probabilities by adding Laplace smoothing or using cosine similarity.\n- **Feature Independence**: While Naive Bayes assumes independence, it often performs well unless features are truly independent.\n- **Zero Frequency**: Use techniques like maximum entropy to avoid zero probabilities when a class has few documents.\n\nThis method ensures accurate classification by considering each feature's contribution independently while maintaining practical handling of edge cases.",

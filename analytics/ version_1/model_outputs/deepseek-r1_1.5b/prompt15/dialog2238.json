    "model_response": "**Answer:**\n\nKeras is a high-level neural networks API built on top of TensorFlow. It simplifies the process of building and training deep learning models by providing a user-friendly interface for defining layers in neural networks. Keras supports both sequential and functional programming paradigms, offering flexibility in model structure. It's particularly effective for image recognition tasks due to its ability to extract high-level features from images.\n\nKey Features:\n1. **High-Level Interface**: Abstracts the complexity of building neural networks, allowing users to define models using simple layers.\n2. **Neural Network Support**: Supports various layers ( Dense, Conv2D) and operations, making it suitable for image recognition tasks.\n3. **Model Visualization**: Tools like `plot_model()` help in understanding the trained model's architecture.\n\nApplications Beyond Image Recognition:\n- Text classification: Convert text to embeddings using techniques like Word2Vec.\n- Regression: Use outputs as continuous values instead of discrete classes.\n\nLimitations and Considerations:\n1. **Lack of GPU Support**: Requires running on CPU for certain operations, limiting parallel computing capabilities.\n2. **Custom Models**: May need custom layers or functions; consider frameworks like Functional API for modular approaches.\n3. **Feature Engineering**: Text features can be converted to numerical representations.\n\nBest Practices:\n- Pre-process data (resize images, normalize), split into training, validation, and test sets.\n- Use callbacks for monitoring performance during training.\n- Consider best practices: Avoid overfitting by using validation metrics; adjust model complexity based on validation results.\n\nWriting Models in Keras:\n- Use functional programming with functions for modularity.\n- Consider implementing custom layers or utilizing existing ones from libraries like Functional API.\n\nOverfitting and Generalization:\n- Use validation metrics to prevent overfitting.\n- Adjust model complexity, increasing layers or reducing capacity as needed.\n\nIn summary, while Keras is powerful for image recognition tasks, it requires careful setup with considerations in feature engineering, model structure, and evaluation. Best practices ensure effective training, preventing overfitting and enhancing generalization.",

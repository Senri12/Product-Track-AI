    "model_response": "To effectively classify emails as spam using a Naive Bayes model, follow this structured approach:\n\n1. **Identify Features**: \n   - Look for specific keywords such as \"phishing,\" \"spamnet,\" or \"bot\" that might indicate phishing attempts.\n   - Consider the presence of known malicious URLs like http://www.myspam.org or https://myspam.org.\n   - Use term frequency vectors (TF-IDF) to normalize word counts, ensuring consistency across different documents.\n\n2. **Naive Bayes Setup**:\n   - Define prior probabilities for spam and non-spam emails based on training data.\n   - Compute likelihoods for each feature given the presence of specific words in spam or non-spam emails.\n\n3. **Model Training and Classification**:\n   - Train the Naive Bayes model using an email dataset labeled as spam or non-spam.\n   - Classify new emails by evaluating the evidence from their features against the computed likelihoods and prior probabilities.\n\n4. **Handling Weak Evidence**:\n   - Use a threshold to determine when the evidence is sufficient for classification, balancing between false positives and false negatives.\n\n5. **Testing and Adjustments**:\n   - Test the model on various datasets to assess performance.\n   - Make adjustments as needed based on results and domain knowledge.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively utilize Naive Bayes to classify emails into spam or non-spam categories.",

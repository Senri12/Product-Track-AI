    "model_response": "To compute the probability of spam for the word \"приз,\" follow this structured approach:\n\n1. **Validate Emails Sent by Other Users:**\n   - Examine validated emails from users who might send fraudulent messages to \" приз.\"\n   - Track how often \" Приз\" appears in these flagged emails.\n\n2. ** keyword Analysis:**\n   - Check the frequency of keywords related to \" Приз\" across validated emails.\n   - Note if other users have attempted to send emails containing similar words from their own accounts or domains.\n\n3. **Subject Line Validation:**\n   - Analyze subject lines for unusual patterns, such as exclamation marks followed by long phrases, which might indicate spam.\n\n4. **Network Access and Domain Checks:**\n   - Verify that \" Приз\" has been sent via legitimate domain names.\n   - Ensure the recipient accounts are owned by trusted entities to prevent misuse.\n\n5. **User Profile Analysis:**\n   - Examine the user profile on a website, if applicable.\n   - Determine if they have multiple email accounts or have tried sending emails from their own account regularly.\n\n6. **Contextual Analysis:**\n   - Consider the context in which these emails are sent, such as common abbreviations versus brand names.\n   - Note the frequency of similar words in user's own email traffic.\n\nBy systematically analyzing each of these aspects and considering trends over time, you can estimate the probability that \" Приз\" is being sent via spambot or phishing. This methodical approach balances data validation with user-specific considerations to provide a comprehensive assessment.",

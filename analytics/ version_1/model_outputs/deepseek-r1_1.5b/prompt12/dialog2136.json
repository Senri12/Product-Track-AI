    "model_response": "**Manhattan Distance Explanation**\n\nThe Manhattan distance, also known as taxicab geometry, measures the distance between two points on a grid by only moving along the x and y axes. Here are the key points:\n\n1. **Definition**: For two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), the Manhattan distance is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Manhattan Distance} = |x2 - x1| + |y2 - y1|\n   \\]\n   This accounts for movement along the grid lines only.\n\n2. **Example Calculation**: \n   - From (0,0) to (3,4):\n     \\[\n     |3-0| + |4-0| = 3 + 4 = 7\n     \\]\n   - From (1,2) to (4,6):\n     \\[\n     |4-1| + |6-2| = 3 + 4 = 7\n     \\]\n\n3. **Real-Life Application**: In Manhattan, navigating through blocks would use manhattan distance, ignoring diagonal movement for efficiency.\n\n4. **Comparison with Other Metrics**:\n   - **Euclidean Distance**: Direct line between points.\n   - **Chebyshev Distance**: Maximum of the x and y differences.\n\n5. **Use Cases**: Common in grid-based navigation, pathfinding algorithms, and city planning.\n\nIn summary, manhattan distance is essential for scenarios where movement along axes is required, offering a straightforward yet effective method to measure distances in grid structures.",

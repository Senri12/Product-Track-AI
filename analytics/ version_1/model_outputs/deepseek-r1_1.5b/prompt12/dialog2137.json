    "model_response": "To calculate the posterior probabilities in a Naive Bayes model, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Compute Prior Probabilities:**\n   - For each class \\( C \\), compute \\( P(C) \\) as the count of samples with class \\( C \\) divided by the total number of samples.\n\n2. **Calculate Likelihoods:**\n   - For each feature \\( F \\) and class \\( C \\), compute \\( P(F|C) \\) assuming independence between features given the class.\n   - This is done by counting occurrences of feature values in data belonging to class \\( C \\).\n\n3. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**\n   - For each class \\( C \\):\n     - Compute the numerator as the product of likelihoods for all features and the prior probability \\( P(C) \\).\n     - Divide this by the total probability across all features, calculated similarly for each class.\n     - The result is the posterior probability \\( P(C|F_1, F_2, ..., F_n) \\).\n\n4. **Determine Class Labels:**\n   - Assign the class with the highest posterior probability to a new observation.\n\n**Example Application:**\n- Suppose features are \\( F1 \\) and \\( F2 \\), classes are A, B, C.\n- For each combination of \\( F1 \\) and \\( F2 \\), compute likelihoods for each class.\n- Calculate posteriors using the formula above.\n\n**Implementation Notes:**\n- Use libraries like scikit-learn in Python for easier implementation, handling edge cases with caution.\n- Consider class balance; rebalancing or stratified sampling may help.\n- Handle missing features appropriately to avoid errors.\n\nBy following these steps, you can accurately compute posterior probabilities using the Naive Bayes model.",

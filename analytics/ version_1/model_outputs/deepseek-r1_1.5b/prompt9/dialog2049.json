    "model_response": "**Explanation**\n\nNaive Bayes is a classification algorithm based on Bayes' Theorem that efficiently models and predicts spam by identifying patterns in emails. This method is suitable for spam detection due to its simplicity and effectiveness with datasets where features are independent or weakly dependent.\n\n**Key Features for Spam Classification:**\n\n1. **Attachments/Image:** Presence of .zip, .pdf, or \"file attached\" indicates potential spam.\n2. **Links:** High number of links pointing to other pages or external sites suggests spam.\n3. **Free/Money Words:** Occurrence of terms like \"free,\" \"money,\" or \"win\" may indicate irrelevant offers.\n\n**Suggested Exercise**\n\nApply these features to real email datasets, such as the Gmail Spam dataset or Enron emails, by modeling each feature and using Naive Bayes to predict spam probability. This involves analyzing presence (yes/no) of these patterns.\n\n**Feedback Loop**\n\nAssess understanding by posing questions about identifying attachments, links, and specific keywords in emails. If a user successfully identifies these features, their application is feasible and aligns with practical email filtering tasks.",

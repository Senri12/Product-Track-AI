    "model_response": "Euclidean metric is a fundamental concept in geometry that measures the distance between two points in an n-dimensional space. It is defined as the straight-line distance, calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 + \\dots + (n_{\\text{th}} - n_{\\text{first}})^2} \\]\n\nThis metric applies to flat spaces and forms the basis for more complex concepts in mathematics and physics. It is also used locally within coordinate systems where space is considered flat, akin to special relativity's Minkowski metric but without relativistic time dilation.\n\nEuclidean distance is essential in various fields, including geometry, physics, and machine learning, providing a simple yet powerful tool for understanding spatial relationships.",

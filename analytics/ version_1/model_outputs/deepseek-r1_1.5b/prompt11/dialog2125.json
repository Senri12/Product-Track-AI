    "model_response": "RMSProp is an optimization algorithm designed to improve the training of machine learning models. It is particularly effective at addressing the noisy nature of gradient estimates and helps prevent over-saturating neural networks. Here's a concise summary:\n\n1. **Concept**: Similar to Adam, RMSProp uses adaptive learning rates for each parameter. Instead of using moving averages based on gradients as in Adam, it maintains an average (variance) of past parameter values.\n\n2. **Key Innovation**:\n   - Rather than squaring the gradient (as in Adam), RMSProp squares the parameter values.\n   - This approach allows parameters with large initial values to be updated more smoothly and reduces sensitivity to learning rate choices.\n\n3. **Update Rule**: Instead of dividing by a moving average based on gradients, RMSProp divides by the square root of the sum of squared past parameters. The update equation is:\n\n   \\[\n   w_{t+1} = w_t - \\text{learning\\_rate} \\times \\frac{g_t}{\\sqrt{\\sum v_t}}\n   \\]\n\n   where \\( g_t \\) are the parameter gradients and \\( v_t \\) is the sum of squares of past parameters.\n\n4. **Comparison with Adam**: Unlike Adam, which uses moving averages for both gradients and squared gradients, RMSProp focuses on adjusting the learning rate based solely on the parameters' values.\n\nIn essence, RMSProp accelerates convergence by stabilizing parameter updates and reducing reliance on gradient noise.",

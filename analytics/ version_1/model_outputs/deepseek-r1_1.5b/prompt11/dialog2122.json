    "model_response": "Adam refers to an optimization algorithm widely used in machine learning, particularly within frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. It combines two key techniques: momentum, which aids convergence by continuing the direction of gradient updates, and adaptive learning rates, which automatically adjust based on data statistics, enhancing performance across features. This combination helps prevent overfitting and accelerates model training, making it a cornerstone in deep learning tasks.",

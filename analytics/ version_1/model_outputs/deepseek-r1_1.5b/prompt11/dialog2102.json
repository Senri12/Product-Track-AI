    "model_response": "selection of the number of neighbors (k) in k-nearest neighbor algorithm depends on several factors including the dataset size, complexity of the problem, and the desired level of noise removal. A common approach is to use cross-validation to determine an appropriate value for k that optimizes the model's performance on unseen data. If a small k is chosen, the model can be more sensitive to outliers and may overfit; if a large k is used, it can lead to overly smooth decision boundaries, potentially underfitting.",

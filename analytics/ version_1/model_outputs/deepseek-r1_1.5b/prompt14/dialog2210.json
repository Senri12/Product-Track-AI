    "model_response": "**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:**\n\n1. **Understanding \"Stochastic\"**:\n   - Stochastic refers to random or probabilistic elements. In SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent), randomness is introduced in the form of randomly selecting subsets of data during each iteration.\n\n2. **Gradients and Optimization**:\n   - Both GD (Gradient Descent) and SGD use gradients, but GD computes a gradient over all data points for a single batch, while SGD uses one or a few samples.\n\n3. **Randomization Process**:\n   - Each iteration in SGD involves computing the gradient based on a randomly selected subset of data (batch). This random selection reduces variance compared to GD, leading to more stable optimization.\n\n4. **Impact on Convergence and Generalization**:\n   - Smaller batches can lead to better generalization by escaping local minima faster due to higher variance in gradients.\n   - While larger batches reduce noise but increase computational cost per iteration.\n\n5. **Practical Implementation Considerations**:\n   - SGD is commonly used in large models where exact training isn't feasible.\n   - Larger batch sizes (e.g., 10-100) can speed up training, while smaller batches may require more iterations for convergence and better generalization.\n\n6. **Adaptive Variants**:\n   - Adaptive variants adjust learning rates or momentum based on gradient noise, enhancing efficiency but requiring complex implementation.\n\n7. **Comparison with GD**:\n   - SGD is computationally less intensive per iteration due to random subsets but offers more stable optimization.\n   - GD requires processing the entire dataset each time, which can be resource-heavy for large models.\n\nIn summary, SGD uses randomly selected subsets of data during optimization, providing stability and reducing variance compared to traditional Gradient Descent. It is particularly useful in large-scale machine learning where exact training isn't feasible, enabling faster convergence and better generalization.",

    "model_response": "To determine \\( F(\\text{DAY}) \\) for each day based on weather conditions, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define Weather Indicators**:\n   - **Rain**: If the rain level is more than 10mm.\n   - **Sun**: If there has been sun for at least 3 hours.\n\n2. **Evaluate Each Day**:\n   - For each day from Monday to Sunday, check if it met either of the weather indicators (rain or sun).\n\n3. **Determine F(DAY)**:\n   - If a day had rain, mark \\( F(\\text{DAY}) \\) as TRUE.\n   - If a day did not have rain but was sunny for at least 3 hours, mark \\( F(\\text{DAY}) \\) as TRUE.\n   - If neither condition was met, mark \\( F(\\text{DAY}) \\) as FALSE.\n\n**Application Example:**\n\n- **Monday**: It rained 10mm. → \\( F(\\text{DAY}) = \\text{TRUE} \\)\n- **Tuesday**: It sunned for 3 hours. → \\( F(\\text{DAY}) = \\text{TRUE} \\)\n- **Wednesday**: Partly cloudy, no rain or sun. → \\( F(\\text{DAY}) = \\text{FALSE} \\)\n- **Thursday**: No indication of weather. → \\( F(\\text{DAY}) = \\text{FALSE} \\)\n- **Friday**: Clear skies with some clouds but no rain or sun. → \\( F(\\text{DAY}) = \\text{FALSE} \\)\n- **Saturday**: Sunny 45 degrees. → \\( F(\\text{DAY}) = \\text{TRUE} \\)\n- **Sunday**: Partly cloudy with light wind, still sunny overall. → \\( F(\\text{DAY}) = \\text{TRUE} \\)\n\n**Conclusion**:\nBy evaluating each day based on the defined weather indicators, we can determine whether it was a DAY for \\( F(\\text{DAY}) \\).",

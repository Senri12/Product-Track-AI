    "model_response": "RMSProp (Root Mean Square Propagation) is an optimization algorithm designed for training neural networks. Unlike Adam, which maintains an adaptive moment estimate (Adam average), RMSProp focuses on scaling the gradient updates based on the root mean square of past gradients. Here's a structured overview:\n\n1. **Concept**: RMSProp aims to improve upon traditional parameter update methods by adjusting each parameter individually based on its own running average of squared gradients.\n\n2. **Update Rule**:\n   - Each parameter is updated using the formula: \n     \\[\n     θ_{t+1} = θ_t - α * g_t / \\sqrt{r_t}\n     \\]\n     Where:\n     - \\( θ \\) are the parameters.\n     - \\( g_t \\) is the gradient at time \\( t \\).\n     - \\( r_t \\) is the running average of squared gradients, maintained with a decay rate (β).\n\n3. **Running Average**:\n   - The running average \\( r_t \\) is updated as:\n     \\[\n     r_t = β * r_{t-1} + (1 - β) * ||g_t||^2\n     \\]\n     This decay mechanism ensures that the running average doesn't accumulate too much over time.\n\n4. **Key Differences from Adam**:\n   - RMSProp does not maintain an average of gradients like Adam; instead, it maintains a running average of squared gradients.\n   - It is particularly effective in homogeneous areas of the loss landscape, where consistent gradient behavior can lead to more stable updates.\n\n5. **Relation to Other Methods**: Similar to AdaGrad, which uses diagonal square roots for parameter updates, RMSProp shares this approach but maintains an overall mean rather than a diagonal matrix.\n\n6. **Benefits**: By scaling gradients using their root mean square values, RMSProp helps prevent the learning process from being too sensitive in homogeneous regions, thus improving training stability and convergence.\n\nIn summary, RMSProp adjusts each parameter's weight based on the root mean square of past gradients, without maintaining an average as Adam does. This approach helps stabilize learning when gradients are consistent across parameters.",

    "model_response": "**Final Answer:**\n\nKeras is a high-level deep learning framework that simplifies the process of building and training neural networks. Here are some key points about Keras:\n\n1. **Layer Organization**: Keras organizes layers into submodules, such as `layers` for traditional neural network components like convolutions and full-connected layers, and `model` for defining complete models.\n\n2. **Integration with TensorFlow**: Keras is built on TensorFlow under the rug, allowing it to leverage its extensive ecosystem, including tools for eager execution (like TensorFlow's), NumPy integration, and PyTorch compatibility.\n\n3. **Functionality**: Keras supports both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks through dedicated modules. It also handles advanced concepts like CNNs and RNNs with specific layer types.\n\n4. **Data Handling**: Efficiently preprocesses data for normalization and scaling, preparing it for model training on either CPU or GPU as needed by the hardware.\n\n5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Provides tools to adjust hyperparameters such as optimizer settings, layer sizes, and dropout rates without custom code.\n\n6. **Collaborative Environment**: Encourages a community where users can share models, fostering learning and innovation in deep learning.\n\n7. **Ecosystem Support**: Works seamlessly with TensorFlow's ecosystem, including features like Dataset for preprocessing, which is invaluable for real-world data challenges.\n\n8. **Learning Curve**: While Keras offers many tools and flexibility, starting with basic tasks like image classification on MNIST prepares users for more complex applications.\n\nIn conclusion, Keras is a versatile tool for deep learning that leverages TensorFlow's strengths, offering layer organization, efficient data handling, and hyperparameter tuning while integrating seamlessly with other frameworks. With time and practice, it can be effectively applied in various scenarios, complementing TensorFlow's broader support.",

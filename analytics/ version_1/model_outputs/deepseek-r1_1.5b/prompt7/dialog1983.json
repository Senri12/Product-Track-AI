    "model_response": "Euclidean metric is a mathematical concept used to define distances between points in an n-dimensional space. It applies to Euclidean geometry, which deals with flat spaces. The Euclidean metric calculates the distance between two points using the square root of the sum of squared differences across all coordinates. This approach is fundamental and widely applicable, serving as a basic yet essential method for measuring distances in various fields such as physics, computer graphics, and beyond.",

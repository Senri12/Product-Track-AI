    "model_response": "Naive Bayes Classifier is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm based on applying Bayes' theorem with the assumption of independence among features. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n1. **Bayes' Theorem**: It is defined as:\n   \\[\n   P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}\n   \\]\n   This formula calculates the probability of event A given event B, incorporating prior knowledge of events A and B.\n\n2. **Naive Assumption**: The \"naive\" part comes from assuming that features are independent of each other. While this is unrealistic in many real-world scenarios, the method still performs well due to its simplicity and efficiency.\n\n3. **Application in the Script**:\n   - The script likely uses Bayes' theorem with binary or categorical features.\n   - For example, using weather features (rain/shine) to predict umbrella carrying behavior.\n\n4. **Handling Different Data Types**:\n   - Binary features are straightforward.\n   - Categorical features might need preprocessing (e.g., one-hot encoding) and feature selection methods to reduce dimensionality.\n\n5. **Computational Considerations**:\n   - Higher dimensions can lead to numerical issues, often handled with approximations or algorithms like decision trees.\n   - Despite the assumption of independence being unrealistic, Naive Bayes remains effective and is used as a baseline for model evaluation.\n\nIn summary, the Naive Bayes classifier applies Bayes' theorem under the assumption of feature independence. It's computationally efficient and can serve as a simple baseline for various classification tasks.",

    "model_response": "To compute the learning rate decay with η₀ = 0.1, t = 5, and T = 10 using a linear decay method, follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Parameters**\n- **η₀ (Initial Learning Rate):** 0.1\n- **t (Training Steps):** 5 (this is where η is set)\n- **T (Total Training Horizon):** 10 (total training time units)\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Decay Schedule**\nSince we have a total of T = 10 training steps and η₀ is set at t = 5, we'll apply linear decay from step 5 onwards. This means the learning rate will decrease uniformly over the remaining 5 steps.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Learning Rate Over Each Step**\nThe initial learning rate is η₀ = 0.1. We need to determine how much it decreases each training step until we reach zero by the end of T = 10.\n\n- **Step 1 to Step 4 (5 steps):** Keep η = 0.1 (since no further decay mentioned)\n- **Steps 6 to 10:** Linearly decrease from 0.1 to 0 over 5 steps\n\n**Step 4: Compute the Decay Amount per Step**\nThe total decay needed is from 0.1 to 0, which is a change of -0.1 over 5 steps (steps 6-10).\n\nChange in learning rate = Final η - Initial η = 0 - 0.1 = -0.1\nNumber of steps for decay = T - t = 10 - 5 = 5\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Learning Rate at Each Step**\nFrom step 6 to step 10, apply a linear decrease:\n\n- **Step 6:** η = 0.1 + ( (-0.1) / 5 ) * (6 - 5) = 0.1 - 0.02 = 0.08\n- **Step 7:** η = 0.1 + ( (-0.1) / 5 ) * (7 - 5) = 0.1 - 0.04 = 0.06\n- **Step 8:** η = 0.1 + ( (-0.1) / 5 ) * (8 - 5) = 0.1 - 0.06 = 0.04\n- **Step 9:** η = 0.1 + ( (-0.1) / 5 ) * (9 - 5) = 0.1 - 0.08 = 0.02\n- **Step 10:** η = 0.1 + ( (-0.1) / 5 ) * (10 - 5) = 0.1 - 0.10 = 0.00\n\n**Final Learning Rate Schedule:**\n- Steps 1-4: η = 0.1\n- Step 5: η = 0.1 (initial point)\n- Steps 6-9: η decreases from 0.08 to 0.00 linearly over steps 6-10.\n- Step 10: η = 0.0\n\nThis approach ensures that the learning rate starts high and gradually decreases, which can help optimize convergence during training.",

    "model_response": "The Newton-Raphson method is an iterative technique used to find successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function. It starts with an initial guess for the root and then uses the function's value and its derivative at that point to refine the guess.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Start with an Initial Guess**: Begin with an initial estimate \\( x_0 \\) for the root of the function \\( f(x) \\).\n\n2. **Compute Function Value and Derivative**: Evaluate the function \\( f(x_0) \\) and its derivative \\( f'(x_0) \\) at the current guess.\n\n3. **Update the Guess**:\n   \\[\n   x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}\n   \\]\n   This formula adjusts the guess based on the function's slope at \\( x_n \\), moving closer to the root where \\( f(x) = 0 \\).\n\n4. **Iterate**: Repeat steps 2 and 3 with \\( x_{n+1} \\) until the approximations converge to a desired accuracy.\n\n**Conditions for Convergence**:\n- The function should be differentiable in an open interval containing the initial guess.\n- The derivative \\( f'(x) \\) should not be zero at any point near the root, preventing division by zero and ensuring convergence.\n\n**Example**: Finding the root of \\( f(x) = x^2 - 4 \\)\n\n1. **Initial Guess**: Let's start with \\( x_0 = 3 \\).\n\n2. **Compute Values**:\n   - \\( f(3) = 5 \\)\n   - \\( f'(3) = 6 \\)\n\n3. **Update Guess**:\n   \\[\n   x_1 = 3 - \\frac{5}{6} \\approx 2.5\n   \\]\n\n4. **Repeat**: Continue with the updated guess until it converges to \\( x = 2 \\).\n\nThe Newton-Raphson method is efficient due to its use of derivatives, but it requires a good initial guess and careful computation to avoid issues like division by zero or divergence.\n\n**Summary**: The Newton-Raphson method is an iterative root-finding technique that uses the function's value and derivative at each step to refine guesses. It converges quickly when the initial guess is sufficiently close to the actual root, provided certain conditions are met.",

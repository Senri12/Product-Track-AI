    "model_response": "Overfitting is a fundamental concept in machine learning that describes a model's excessive complexity leading it to fit the training data too closely. Here's a structured explanation of how overfitting occurs, its detection methods, and implications:\n\n### Occurrence of Overfitting:\n1. **High Complexity**: A model with excessive complexity (too many parameters or depth) may focus solely on fitting the noise in the training data rather than capturing underlying patterns.\n2. **Biased vs. Unbiased Models**: A low-bias model has high variance, meaning it makes broad assumptions that don't fit new data. A high-bias model has low variance, fitting tightly to the training data.\n\n### Detection Methods:\n1. **Cross-Validation**: Techniques like k-fold cross-validation help assess a model's generalization ability by evaluating performance on multiple subsets.\n2. **Bias and Variance Metrics**: High bias (high variance) is indicated by poor performance on both training and validation sets, while low variance (low bias) suggests overfitting.\n\n### Balancing Model Complexity:\n- Regularization techniques such as Ridge Regression and Lasso help reduce overfitting by adding penalties to coefficients, forcing simpler models.\n- Understanding the bias-variance tradeoff reveals that optimal complexity is where the model neither underfits nor overfits.\n\n### Example:\nUsing house price prediction based on features like size and number of rooms. A simple linear model (low complexity) performs well on training data but poorly on new data. Expanding the model's complexity by adding non-linear terms reduces bias, thus preventing overfitting.\n\nIn conclusion, overfitting arises when a model is too complex, causing it to fit only the training data. Detection involves methods like cross-validation and examining metrics like bias and variance. Balancing model complexity via regularization techniques helps mitigate this issue.",

    "model_response": "Adagrad is an optimization algorithm that adjusts the learning rate per parameter by accumulating the squared gradients across training steps, rather than using a fixed value or the current gradient magnitude. Here's a breakdown of the provided example:\n\n1. **Understanding Adagrad**: Adagrad maintains a sum of squares matrix \\( G \\) where each element accumulates the square of the parameter's gradient over time.\n\n2. **Example Variables**:\n   - \\( G_{t-1,i} = 4 \\): Squared value of the gradient at time step \\( t-1 \\).\n   - \\( G_t = 2 \\): Squared value of the gradient at time step \\( t \\).\n\n3. **Adagrad Update Step**:\n   - The update for parameter \\( i \\) uses the current gradient squared divided by a running average of past gradients squared plus epsilon to compute the adaptive learning rate.\n   - In this example, dividing \\( G_t = 2 \\) by \\( G_{t-1,i} + \\epsilon = 4 + 1e-8 \\) shows how Adagrad adapts each parameter individually based on their current gradient.\n\n**Conclusion**: The example demonstrates Adagrad's approach to dynamically adjust learning rates per parameter, improving convergence by maintaining an adaptive sum of squared gradients.",

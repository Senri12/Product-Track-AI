    "model_response": "RMSProp (Root Mean Squared Propagation) is an optimization algorithm designed to improve the training of deep neural networks by addressing some limitations of other methods like Adam. It was introduced in the paper \"Stochastic Gradient Explorations\" by H. Yu and R. J. Simon in 2015.\n\n### Key Concepts:\n\n1. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** RMSProp uses RMSE instead of the sum-squared function used by methods like Adam. This change makes it more stable and prevents the parameters from oscillating too much during optimization.\n\n2. **Adaptive Learning Rates:** Unlike other optimizers that use a fixed learning rate, RMSProp adjusts the learning rate for each parameter based on the history of gradients. It uses an adaptive average of squared gradients to compute this adjustment.\n\n3. **Graduation Cycle:** The denominator in the update step is an average of squared gradients from recent steps. This means that if a parameter has recently had large gradient values, its learning rate will be smaller, helping prevent oscillations and stabilizing training.\n\n4. **Parameter-Specific Learning Rates:** Unlike Adam, which uses a single learning rate for all parameters, RMSProp treats each parameter differently based on its architecture. The adaptive rates are updated dynamically during training.\n\n### How It Works:\n\n- **Gradient Division:** Each parameter's gradient is divided by an adaptive learning rate computed from the root mean squared of recent gradients.\n  \n- **Squared Gradients Denominator:** The denominator in this division uses a moving average of squared gradients across parameters to compute the adaptive learning rates. This dynamic adjustment helps handle varying scales of gradients and prevents overshooting the minimum.\n\n### Differences from Other Optimizers:\n\n- **Stability and Convergence:** RMSProp is noted for its stability, especially in handling parameters with different scales.\n  \n- **Implementation Differences:** Unlike Adam, which uses a sum-squared function without square roots, RMSProp employs root mean squared gradients. This makes it more stable during optimization.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nRMSProp is an adaptive optimization algorithm that adjusts the learning rate for each parameter based on its recent history of gradients. By using RMSE and averaging squared gradients, it provides a stable training environment while being sensitive to the model's architecture and parameters.",

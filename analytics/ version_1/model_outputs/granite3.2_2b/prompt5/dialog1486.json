    "model_response": "Autograd is not directly related to our current lecture topic. However, let's delve into it for the sake of comprehension. In the context of machine learning and deep learning, Autograd is a library primarily used with TensorFlow or PyTorch frameworks in Python. It allows automatic computation of gradients, which are essential for training neural networks using optimization techniques like stochastic gradient descent (SGD). \n\nWith Autograd, each operation in your computational graph can track its input-output relationships and compute the necessary derivatives automatically. This makes it easier to implement complex operations within these frameworks without having to manually differentiate your models. It significantly simplifies the process of backpropagation, which is a method used by gradient-based learning methods for calculating gradients in a neural network.",

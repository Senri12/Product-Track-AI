    "model_response": "As an academic assistant focusing on geometric principles and Euclidean distance calculation, let's reframe this as:\n\nTo calculate the Euclidean distance between two points in a Cartesian plane, we use the formula:\n\nd = √[(x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²]\n\nWhere (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are coordinates of the points. \n\nGiven points are (1, 2) and (3, 4). Plugging these into our formula:\n\nd = √[(3 - 1)² + (4 - 2)²]\n   = √[(2)² + (2)²]\n   = √[4 + 4]\n   = √8\n\nThe exact distance is √8, which simplifies to 2√2. \n\nSo, the Euclidean distance between (1, 2) and (3, 4) is 2√2.",

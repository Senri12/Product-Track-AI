    "model_response": "To calculate v_t in the context of Momentum learning rate, we use the formula for each update step:\n\nv_t = γ * v_(t-1) + η * ∇L\n\nWhere:\n- γ (gamma) is the momentum factor (0.9 in your case)\n- v_(t-1) is the velocity from the previous time step (given as 1 here)\n- η (eta) is the learning rate (given as 0.1 here)\n- ∇L represents the gradient of the loss function (not provided, but let's assume this value stays constant for each update)\n\nNow we can calculate v_t:\n\nv_t = 0.9 * 1 + 0.1 * ∇L\n  = 0.9 + 0.1*∇L\n\nSince ∇L is not given, this expression represents the updated velocity for each time step based on the provided values of γ and η. To find an exact numerical value for v_t, we'd need to know the constant gradient ∇L. The result would be a new value that will be used as the initial velocity in subsequent calculations until a different learning rate or momentum factor is set.",

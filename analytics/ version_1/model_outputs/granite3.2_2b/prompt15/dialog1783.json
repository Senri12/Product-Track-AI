    "model_response": "Student Response:\n\n\"F(д) = 25°C - (0.6 * 18°C)\"\n\nFeedback:\n\nYour calculation appears to be correct for the given example regarding weather conditions. Here's a breakdown of your response:\n\n1. You've correctly identified F(д), which represents temperature in degrees Celsius.\n2. You've used the formula to calculate it - this is an excellent sign, as using the right formula is crucial for accurate calculations. The formula generally relates to converting a temperature from another scale (like Fahrenheit) into Celsius. In your case, you seem to have applied the formula correctly: \"F(д) = (C - 32) * 5/9\".\n3. You've taken 0.6 as part of this calculation and used it consistently across both temperature values. This shows a good understanding of how constants may be incorporated into such formulas.\n4. The result, 25°C - (0.6 * 18°C), matches the expected value for F(д) when applying your formula correctly.\n\nSuggestions and Follow-up Questions:\n\n1. You've used subtraction to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius, which is commendable. It's important to keep this consistent in all similar calculations.\n2. In case you were applying a different formula (like the one provided earlier), could you explain why you chose 0.6 instead of a different constant? This context can help solidify your understanding of how these constants fit into conversion formulas.\n3. Practice calculating F(д) for a few more examples with varied input temperatures in Fahrenheit to ensure you're comfortable and confident applying this formula consistently. \n\nRemember, accuracy is key. A small mistake can lead to significant errors when converting between these scales. Good job so far! Keep up the good work.",

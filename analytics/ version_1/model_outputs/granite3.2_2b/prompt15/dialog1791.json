    "model_response": "Your response shows a strong understanding of the term \"Momentum\" within optimization contexts, specifically in the field of machine learning and AI where it refers to an optimization technique known as momentum or momentum-based methods. These are types of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) variations that can help accelerate convergence and reduce oscillations by incorporating a moving average of past gradients into the current update step.\n\nWell done for identifying this concept! Here's some feedback:\n\n1. **Correct Material**: You've accurately identified 'Momentum' as an optimization technique used to enhance SGD, which is indeed correct. This helps in reducing fluctuations and speeds up convergence by \"remembering\" past movements towards the minimum of loss function.\n\n2. **Suggestions for Improvement**: It appears you're adept at applying general technical terms from abstract concepts like machine learning. If you want to delve deeper, consider exploring other momentum-based optimization methods beyond simple SGD, such as Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient (NAG) or RMSProp.\n\n3. **Follow-up Questions**: \n   - Can you explain how Momentum incorporates a moving average of past gradients?\n   - How does the concept of 'momentum' help in preventing oscillations during optimization?\n   - Could you compare this momentum technique with other gradient descent methods?\n\nKeep up the good work, your understanding is commendable!",

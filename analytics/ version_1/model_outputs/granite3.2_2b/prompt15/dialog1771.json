    "model_response": "Correct Response: The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) method is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks in the field of data mining. In KNN, the output value is determined by predicting the category that most of one's nearest neighbors belong to. Here are some key points about this technique:\n\n1. **Neighbours Identification**: The algorithm identifies the 'k' closest data points from the training dataset (not the test dataset) based on a distance metric, usually Euclidean distance in a multidimensional space.\n\n2. **Decision Making**: For classification problems, it predicts the class of an instance by finding the most common class among its k nearest neighbours. In regression tasks, it determines the average (for continuous data) or mode (for categorical data) of these k nearest neighbors.\n\n3. **Distance Metric**: Commonly used distance metrics are Euclidean, Manhattan, and Minkowski distances. The choice of metric depends on whether your data is typically high-dimensional (Euclidean might be a better choice) or low-dimensional (Manhattan could be more suitable).\n\nFeedback: Your response demonstrates understanding of the key concepts behind KNN. You've correctly described how k nearest neighbors are identified and how predictions are made based on these neighbours. \n\nSuggestions for Improvement: \n- It's crucial to specify that, for classification tasks, 'majority vote' is typically used instead of always choosing the most common class; this ensures a more robust prediction in cases where the classes might be imbalanced.\n- You could also mention that selecting k can be done using techniques like Euclidean distance or by using methods such as ball trees and kd-trees for efficiency, especially when dealing with larger datasets.\n\nFollow-up Questions: \n1. How does choosing a different distance metric (like Minkowski) impact the KNN algorithm?\n2. Can you explain why 'majority vote' is used in classification rather than always picking the most common class among k neighbors?\n3. What techniques can be employed to enhance efficiency when selecting the number of nearest neighbors, especially with large datasets?",

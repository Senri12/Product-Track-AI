    "model_response": "To approach this problem using Socratic questioning, let's first clarify what we know about F(да). In the context of weather data, if \"F(да)\" signifies a certain function or calculation related to weather indicators such as temperature (F for Fahrenheit), humidity, wind speed, etc., it implies that this is a function applied to specific meteorological factors. \n\n1. What does 'да' represent in 'F(да)'? Is it an abbreviation for any particular weather condition or measurement?\n2. Could you provide the formula or definition of F(да)? If not given directly, could we infer its form from typical weather data computations (e.g., temperature anomaly, relative humidity index, etc.)?\n3. Do you have any sample inputs or conditions under which 'F(да)' has been calculated in this context?\n4. What kind of output does F(да) yield for these input values? Is it a scalar value, a vector, or perhaps another type of data structure?\n5. Can we identify what this function might represent in the broader scheme of weather forecasting or analysis? \n\nOnce we've clarified 'F(да)' and understood its role within a weather context, we can proceed with calculating F(да) for testing purposes based on provided input values.\n\nLet's assume, for illustration:\n'да' stands for \"daily average temperature\" in degrees Fahrenheit.\nThe formula is F(да) = 2 * da - 32 (converting from Celsius to Fahrenheit and adding a constant).\n\nNow, suppose we have an input daily average temperature of 50°C for testing:\n1. Convert this value from Celsius to Fahrenheit using the standard formula: F = C * 9/5 + 32. In this case, F = 50 * 9/5 + 32 = 122°F.\n2. Apply the 'F(да)' formula with our converted temperature value: F(да) = 2*122 - 32 = 244 - 32 = 212 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nSo, based on our assumptions and calculations, F(50°C) would be approximately 212 for the purpose of this test.",

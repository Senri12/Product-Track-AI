    "model_response": "Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is an optimization algorithm used to minimize some function by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent as defined by the negative of the gradient. Here's how you can calculate SGD steps for a given problem:\n\n1. **Function and Initial Conditions**: We're given L(w) = w^2, with an initial value of w = 3 and learning rate η = 0.1. \n\n2. **Calculate the Gradient (SGD Step Size)**: The gradient is calculated as the derivative of the function L(w). For L(w) = w^2, this is:\n\n   dL/dw = 2*w\n\n   So, for w = 3:\n   dL/dw = 2*3 = 6\n\n3. **SGD Update Rule**: This rule tells us how much we should adjust our current parameter (w) at each iteration. It's the gradient multiplied by the learning rate η:\n\n   New_w = Old_w - η * dL/dw\n\n   Substituting the values:\n   New_w = 3 - 0.1*6\n   New_w = 3 - 0.6\n   New_w = 2.4\n\n4. **Repeat**: Now, we use this new value (2.4) as our new 'w' and repeat the process. At each step, you would calculate dL/dw again using the new w, then apply the SGD update rule:\n\n   dL/dw with w = 2.4 = 2*2.4 = 4.8\n   New_w = 2.4 - 0.1*4.8\n           = 2.4 - 0.48\n           = 2\n\nAnd so on. This is the basic process of SGD for our specific problem. It's a way to iteratively improve your guess (the parameter 'w') by continuously moving in the direction that decreases the function L(w). \n\nRemember, real-world applications often involve large datasets or high-dimensional spaces where each calculation might be more complex due to vector and matrix operations, but this fundamental approach remains consistent.",

    "model_response": "Sure, let's work through this problem together step by step, just as if we were solving a mathematical problem in school.\n\nWe're given the equation: ∇ (ω - γ * v_{t-1})\n\nHere are the steps to solve it:\n\nStep 1: Substitute the known values into the formula.\nγ = 0.9, v = 1 and ∇ = 2\n\nSo, our equation looks like this now: ∇ (ω - γ * v_{t-1})\n\nStep 2: Calculate γ * v_{t-1} using the known values for γ and v.\nγ * v_{t-1} = 0.9 * 1\n           = 0.9\n\nStep 3: Now, substitute this result into our original equation.\n∇ (ω - 0.9)\n\nStep 4: Simplify the expression by performing subtraction inside the parentheses.\n= ∇ (ω - 0.9)\n= ∇ (ω - 0.9)\n(Note that there's no need to calculate ω because it's not provided in this context.)\n\nSo, your final result would be:\n∇ (ω - γ * v_{t-1}) = ∇ (ω - 0.9)\n\nIf you have additional information about the value of ω or any other variables that might affect it, we could continue solving with that. But based on what's given in your equation, this is the solution:\n\n∇ (ω - γ * v_{t-1}) = ∇ (ω - 0.9)",

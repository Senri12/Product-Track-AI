    "model_response": "Naive Bayes is a popular machine learning algorithm used for text classification tasks, including spam detection. To classify an email as spam using the Naive Bayes method, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Data Preparation**: Gather and prepare your dataset. This should include emails that are known to be either \"spam\" or \"ham\" (non-spam). Each email should be represented as a vector of words (tokens) where each word is assigned a number. For instance, an email like \"Win Big!\" could be converted into [1, 4, 8, ...], where the numbers represent tokenized words.\n\n2. **Tokenization**: Break down the text into individual words or tokens. This can be done using libraries such as NLTK in Python.\n\n   For example:\n   ```python\n   from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\n   \n   email = \"Win Big!\"\n   tokens = word_tokenize(email)  # Output: ['Win', 'Big']\n   ```\n\n3. **Feature Extraction**: Convert each token into numerical features that your algorithm can understand. This is typically done using a technique called Bag of Words (BoW). In BoW, we only consider the presence or absence of words in an email (binary feature representation), ignoring word order and frequency.\n\n   ```python\n   from nltk.corpus import stopwords\n   \n   stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))  # Set of English stop words\n\n   def num_tokens(email):\n       return len([word for word in tokens if word not in stop_words])\n\n   spam_count = num_tokens(\"Win Big!\")\n   ham_count = num_tokens(\"I love reading books.\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Training the Model**: Use your prepared dataset to train a Naive Bayes classifier. In Python, you can use scikit-learn library:\n\n   ```python\n   from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\n   from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\n\n   vectorizer = CountVectorizer()\n   \n   spam_emails = [\"Win Big!\", \"Congratulations! You've won $500.\"] # Example of spam emails\n   ham_emails = [\"I love reading books.\", \"Can I assist you with something?\"]  # Example of ham (non-spam) emails\n\n   X_train_spam = vectorizer.fit_transform(spam_emails)\n   y_train_spam = [1] * len(spam_emails)  # Marks as spam\n   X_train_ham = vectorizer.transform(ham_emails)\n   y_train_ham = [0] * len(ham_emails)  # Marks as ham\n\n   classifier = MultinomialNB()\n   classifier.fit(X_train_spam, y_train_spam)\n   ```\n\n5. **Testing**: Once the model is trained, you can use it to predict whether a new email is spam or not by transforming its tokens and passing through the fitted classifier:\n\n   ```python\n   def classify_email(email):\n       tokenized = vectorizer.transform([email])  # Transform email into numerical features\n       prediction = classifier.predict(tokenized)\n\n       return \"Spam\" if prediction[0] == 1 else \"Ham\"  # Based on the class label (0 for ham, 1 for spam)\n\n   print(classify_email(\"Win Big!\"))  # Output: Spam\n   ```\n\nThis is a simplified example and real-world applications of Naive Bayes for email spam detection often involve more sophisticated preprocessing steps like removing punctuation or normalizing text, as well as feature extraction methods beyond Bag of Words.",

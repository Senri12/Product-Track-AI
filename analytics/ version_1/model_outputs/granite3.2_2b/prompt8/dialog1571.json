    "model_response": "As a text clarifying assistant, I need to ensure your question is clear and understandable. Let's break down what you're asking:\n\n1. \"Вычисли\" - This means \"calculate\". You want the probability of spam related to the word 'приз' (prize).\n2. \"время\" - I assume this refers to a specific dataset or example where words are labeled as either 'spam' or 'not spam'.\n3. \"'приз'\" - This is the word we're interested in calculating probability for. It translates to 'prize' in English.\n\nBased on your request, it seems you want an estimation of how likely a message containing the word 'приз' (prize) would be classified as spam, given a certain dataset. Could you please provide the specific dataset or example where such words are labeled? Also, is this for a binary classification task (spam/not spam)? This will help me give an accurate explanation and calculation of the probability.",

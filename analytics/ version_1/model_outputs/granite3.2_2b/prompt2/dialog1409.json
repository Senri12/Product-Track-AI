    "model_response": "To calculate the learning rate decay with a given linear schedule, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine how many time steps (t) have passed so far. In this case, you've provided t = 5.\n2. Calculate the total number of time steps T (which is the final point in your learning rate schedule). You've stated T=10.\n3. Apply a linear decay function to find out how much the learning rate will decrease from its initial value η0. The formula for this is: `η = η0 * (T - t) / T`.\n\nLet's plug in the values provided into this formula:\n\n`η = 0.1 * ((10 - 5) / 10)`\n\n`η = 0.1 * 0.5`\n\n`η = 0.05`\n\nSo, after 5 time steps out of a total of 10, the learning rate will decay to 0.05 using a linear schedule with η0=0.1 and T=10.",

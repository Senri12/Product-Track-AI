    "model_response": "Keras is a high-level neural network API, written in Python. It's designed to enable fast experimentation with deep neural networks for beginners and professionals alike. The primary strength of Keras lies in its user-friendliness and ease of use, making it an excellent choice for tasks like building machine learning models.\n\nKey features include:\n1. User-friendly: It allows developers to build models quickly without getting bogged down by low-level details.\n2. Flexible: Keras can run on top of TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, or Theano, providing flexibility in choice of backend.\n3. Modular: Models are composed of layers, allowing for easy customization and construction.\n4. Production Ready: It can handle large batch training, making it suitable for large-scale tasks.\n\nTo better understand Keras, here are some clarifying questions:\n1. Are you familiar with Python? If not, would you like a brief introduction to how it's used with Keras?\n2. Do you have prior experience in machine learning or deep learning? This could help determine whether we focus on the basics of using Keras for beginners or more advanced topics.\n3. What specific aspects of Keras are you interested in: perhaps its use in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image processing, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequence data, or something else?",

    "model_response": "Alright, let's work through this problem step by step to compute the velocity at time step t (v_t) using the momentum method with given parameters. \n\nStep 1: Start with known values\n- We have γ = 0.9\n- v_{t-1} = 1\n- ∇L = 2\n- η = 0.1\n\nStep 2: Calculate the term involving momentum (p_t) using the previous velocity (v_{t-1}) and the learning rate η. The formula for this is:\n    p_t = γ * p_{t-1} + η * v_{t-1}\n\n    Let's substitute our known values into this equation:\n    p_t = 0.9 * p_{t-1} + 0.1 * 1\n\nStep 3: We'll need to know the initial momentum, which isn't provided in the problem. For now, let's assume p_0 (the initial momentum) is a variable 'm'. So we can rewrite our equation as:\n    p_t = 0.9 * m + 0.1\n\nStep 4: Now, compute v_t using p_t and ∇L. The formula for this is:\n    v_t = γ * p_t + ∇L\n\n    Substitute the value of p_t from Step 3 into this equation:\n    v_t = 0.9 * (0.9 * m + 0.1) + 2\n\nStep 5: Let's solve for v_t. Begin by expanding and simplifying:\n    v_t = 0.81m + 0.09 + 2\n    \nNow, we can simplify this further to get a single value for v_t:\n    v_t = 0.81m + 2.09\n\nSince m (initial momentum) is unknown, the final expression for v_t depends on it. \n\nExercise: Now, try to solve for 'm' if you were given that v_t equals 5. This would set up a simple equation that can be solved algebraically.",

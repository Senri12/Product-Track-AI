    "model_response": "**Explanation:**\nEuclidean distance, also known as Euclidean metric or simply \"Euclidean,\" is a measure of the straight-line (as opposed to the diagonal) distance between two points in n-dimensional space. It's derived from the well-known formula for the length of a line segment between two points: d = √[(x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)² + ... + (xn - x1)²]. This formula stems from Pythagoras' theorem, where 'd' represents distance, and (x1, y1), (x2, y2) are coordinates of two points. \n\n**Question for Student:**\nCan you explain why Euclidean distance is often referred to as \"straight-line\" distance? What makes it different from other types of distances?\n\n**Suggested Exercise:**\n\n1. Consider two points in 3D space: Point A (1,2,3) and Point B (4,5,6). Calculate the Euclidean distance between these points using the formula d = √[(x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)² + (z2 - z1)²].\n2. Now imagine you're trying to navigate a maze where each square is represented by a coordinate pair. Calculate how far apart two adjacent squares are in this 3D maze using Euclidean distance. \n\n**Feedback Loop:**\nPlease provide the calculated distances for both exercises in your response. This will help me assess whether you've understood and correctly applied the formula to determine Euclidean distance. After sharing, we can discuss any discrepancies or further explore concepts related to distance metrics in higher dimensions.",

    "model_response": "**Explanation:**\n\nIn optimization, \"Momentum\" refers to an algorithmic technique or strategy that aims to accelerate stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in the right direction by adding a fraction of previous updates to the current one. This is done to reduce oscillations and help algorithms converge faster towards the optimal solution. \n\nThe momentum term, denoted as 'β' (beta), typically lies within [0, 1]. During each iteration, it helps in smoothing out the loss surface by carrying along the previous direction of steepest descent, amplifying it if moving in that direction and reducing its influence otherwise. This results in a more stable update for the parameters being optimized.\n\n**Question for Student:**\nCan you name another optimization method besides SGD to which Momentum technique can be applied? \n\n**Suggested Exercise:**\nImagine you are working with a neural network using an optimizer like Momentum. For this exercise, describe how the momentum term would affect update steps if β = 0.5 and the current step is in the direction of decreasing loss (positive slope).\n\n**Feedback Loop:**\n\n1. **Student Input:** If you named Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as another method applicable to Momentum, you're correct. Momentum can indeed be applied with SGD to enhance its performance and speed up convergence by incorporating a form of 'memory' from previous steps.\n\n   For instance, if β = 0.5, the update equation for an 'm' parameter in the direction that decreases loss would look like this: `v_t = β * v_{t-1} + (1 - β) * gradient_t` and subsequently, `parameter_t = parameter_{t-1} - v_t`. This implies each step carries forward 50% of the previous velocity term.\n\n2. **Correctness Feedback:** Excellent! Your response correctly identified that Momentum can be applied with SGD, and you also provided a clear interpretation of how the momentum term would affect updates when β = 0.5 in a decreasing-loss scenario. \n\n3. **Next Steps:** Now, let's consider what happens if β were set to 0 (zero). How would this alter the update process?",

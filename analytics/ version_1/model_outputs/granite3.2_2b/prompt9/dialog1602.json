    "model_response": "**Explanation:**\n\nTo find the Euclidean distance between two points in a Cartesian plane, you use the formula: d = sqrt[(x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²], where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are coordinates of the two points.\n\nGiven points are (1, 2) and (3, 4). Thus, (x1, y1) = (1, 2), and (x2, y2) = (3, 4).\n\n**Question for Student:**\nCan you plug these values into the Euclidean distance formula and compute the result? \n\n**Suggested Exercise:**\n\n1. Begin by identifying which coordinates belong to point A: (1, 2), and which to point B: (3, 4).\n2. Then apply the formula d = sqrt[(x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²].\n3. Compute the result using these values:\n   d = sqrt[(3-1)^2 + (4-2)^2]\n4. Simplify and provide the final Euclidean distance value between points A and B.\n\n**Feedback Loop:**\n\nUpon receiving your answer, I'll check if it matches with the expected result. The correct computation should be:\n\nd = sqrt[(3 - 1)² + (4 - 2)²]\n   = sqrt[2² + 2²]\n   = sqrt[4 + 4]\n   = sqrt[8]\n   ≈ 2.828\n\nPlease confirm your answer matches this value or provide the computation if it differs. If you need assistance with any mathematical steps, let me know!",

    "model_response": "(In English) What's the difference between k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Weighted k-NN?\n\nThe primary difference lies in how the influence or \"weight\" is given to neighboring data points in a classification or regression task. \n\n1. **Standard k-NN**: In traditional k-NN, each of the k closest data points to an unlabeled point (also called the query point) has equal importance. The class label or value at the query point is determined by a simple majority vote among its nearest neighbors. This means that if you have 3 features (or attributes), every feature gets counted equally for classification, regardless of how important it might be in predicting the outcome.\n\n2. **Weighted k-NN**: Here, instead of equal weight for all k closest points, weights are assigned to each neighbor based on their proximity or distance from the query point. The key advantage is that this method can take into account the \"importance\" or relevance of different features by giving more weight to neighbors that lie closer to the query point in those feature spaces. This means if a particular feature consistently brings closer points with similar labels, those neighboring data points will be given higher weights. The final prediction at the query point is then calculated as a weighted average of these neighbors' class labels.\n\nThe main benefit of using Weighted k-NN over traditional k-NN is its ability to better capture local structure in the data and potentially improve performance, especially when certain features are more predictive than others for the target variable. However, it also increases computational complexity as you're dealing with multiple weights instead of just one for each neighbor.",

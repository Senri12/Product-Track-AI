    "model_response": "Momentum, in the context of optimization, is a technique used to accelerate gradient descent methods by adding a fraction of previous updates as the next step's update direction. It was introduced by Geoffrey Hinton and his team at the University of Toronto. The idea behind momentum is to maintain the current direction of movement and help the algorithm to jump over local optima, thereby speeding up convergence towards global optima in certain cases.\n\nImagine you're walking through a forest (our optimization landscape) looking for the best path downhill. Normally, you'd pick the steepest direction at each step. However, with momentum, you start moving in that direction but also carry the momentum of your previous steps. This means if you previously stepped uphill and then downwards, momentum would help carry this initial upward motion to continue moving slightly uphill even though the overall trend is downward. \n\nThe formula for calculating Momentum at step t is:\n\nv_t = β * v_{t-1} + (1 - β) * ∇E/∇w_t\n\nwhere:\n- v_t represents momentum at time t\n- β is the momentum term, typically a small value between 0 and 1, suggesting how much we should 'carry' from previous steps. It's often set to 0.9.\n- ∇E/∇w_t is the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weight at time t.\n\nBy using momentum, an optimizer can reduce oscillations and potentially speed up convergence towards a good solution, especially when dealing with noisy or large datasets. Keep in mind though that it may not always lead to faster convergence than regular gradient descent, depending on the specific problem and its characteristics.",

    "model_response": "As an adaptive tutor, I'll guide you through calculating one step of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) for the given function L(w)=w² with initial weight w=3 and learning rate η=0.1.\n\nStep 1: To start SGD, we need to pick a random example from our dataset at each iteration. In this case, let's assume we have just one data point for simplicity. Let's say the weight (our input) is represented as x. \n\nSince we don't know the exact function or values of other parameters in your case, let's arbitrarily choose x = 2.\n\nStep 2: Now, calculate the gradient (the change in L(w)) with respect to w for this chosen example using basic calculus:\n\n∂L/∂w = 2w (because d/dx (w²) = 2w)\n\nSo, for our random x=2 and initial weight w=3:\n\n∂L/∂w = 2 * 3 = 6\n\nStep 3: Apply the learning rate η to this gradient:\n\nδw = -η * ∂L/∂w\n         = -0.1 * 6\n         = -0.6\n\nStep 4: Update your weight (our input) using this calculated step size:\n\nw_new = w + δw\n       = 3 + (-0.6)\n       = 2.4\n\nSo, after one step of SGD for L(w)=w² with initial conditions as mentioned, our weight is now 2.4 instead of the original 3. \n\nThis means we've made a decrease in w by 0.6. Note that this value could vary each time you run the algorithm due to its stochastic nature—picking different examples each iteration.",

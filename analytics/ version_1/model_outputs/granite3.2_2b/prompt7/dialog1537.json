    "model_response": "Naive Bayes is a classification technique based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features. It's used when dealing with categorical data. Here, we're considering a class variable and multiple predictors (features). The formula for calculating the probability of a class y given predictor values x1, x2, ..., xn is:\n\nP(y|x1, x2, ..., xn) = P(x1, x2, ..., xn | y) * P(y) / P(x1, x2, ..., xn)\n\nWhere:\n- P(y|x1, x2, ..., xn) is the posterior probability of the class given the features. This represents our desired output.\n- P(x1, x2, ..., xn | y) is the likelihood, which is the probability of observing the features given that the class is y. It's computed using the product of the probabilities of each individual feature given the class (P(x1|y), P(x2|y), ..., P(xn|y)).\n- P(y) is the prior probability, representing our initial belief or estimate of the class before seeing any features. This can be computed as the frequency of that class in your training data.\n- P(x1, x2, ..., xn) is the marginal likelihood, which acts as a normalizing constant to ensure that the posterior probabilities sum up to 1.\n\nNow, let's consider an exercise problem:\n\nSuppose we have a binary classification task where our class labels are 'Positive' or 'Negative', and we're given features such as 'Smile_Frequency' (binary: smiles often/doesn't smile often), 'Laughs_Often' (binary: laughs frequently/doesn't laugh frequently), and 'Eye_Contact' (binary: maintains eye contact/looks away). We have the following data to calculate P(y|x):\n\n| Feature | Positive | Negative |\n|---------|:--------|----------|\n| Smile_Frequency | 0.75 | 0.25    |\n| Laughs_Often | 0.6 | 0.4      |\n| Eye_Contact | 0.8 | 0.2     |\n\n1) Calculate P(Positive).\n2) Assume our prior probability for 'Positive' is 0.5. What will be the likelihood of observing these features given 'Positive'? Use this information to calculate P(x|y = Positive), and then find out what's P(x).\n3) Finally, assuming we've observed feature values (Smile_Frequency=1, Laughs_Often=0, Eye_Contact=1), compute the posterior probability that a sample is 'Positive' using Bayes' theorem.\n\nAfter you provide your answers to these questions, I'll evaluate them step by step.",

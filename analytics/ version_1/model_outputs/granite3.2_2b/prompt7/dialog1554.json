    "model_response": "Method of Newton, also known as \"Newton's Method,\" is an algorithm used to find successive approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function. It works by using tangent lines at each step to get closer and closer to the actual root. \n\n**Practice Problem:** Apply Newton's method to solve the following equation: `f(x) = x^2 - 3`. Find an approximation for the root, which is `x` such that `f(x) = 0`, starting with the initial guess of `x0 = 4`.\n\n**Solution Approach:**\n\n1. Start with your initial guess: `x_0 = 4`.\n2. Compute the next approximation using Newton's formula, which is `x_n+1 = x_n - f(x_n) / f'(x_n)`.\n   - Here, `f(x) = x^2 - 3`, so `f'(x) = 2*x`.\n3. Plug in your values: \n   `x_1 = x_0 - (f(x_0)) / f'(x_0)`\n   `= 4 - ((4^2 - 3) / (2*4))`\n   `= 4 - (13/8)`\n   `= 4 - 1.625`\n   `= 2.375`.\n4. Now repeat the process with your new guess: \n   `x_2 = x_1 - (f(x_1)) / f'(x_1)`\n   `= 2.375 - ((2.375^2 - 3) / (2*2.375))`\n   `= 2.375 - (6.60625/4.75)`\n   `= 2.375 - 1.3894375`\n   `= 1.\n\nSo, your approximation for the root using Newton's method with an initial guess of 4 is **1**. This indicates that `x ≈ 1`. As you keep iterating this process, your estimate should get closer to the actual root - in this case, it turns out we've already determined it was 1.\n\nNow, let's check your understanding: \n\n**Quiz Question:** Apply Newton's method again to solve `f(x) = x^3 - 5` starting from an initial guess of `x0 = -2`. What is the second approximation (`x_2`)?",

    "model_response": "SGD, or Stochastic Gradient Descent, is a popular optimization algorithm used in machine learning to minimize the cost function by iteratively moving towards a local minimum. The 'stochastic' aspect refers to the use of one single training example (or a small batch) at each iteration rather than the entire dataset.\n\n**Practice Problem:**\nYou've been given an implementation of SGD where it updates weights after every training instance. Suppose your cost function is quadratic: `J(θ) = 1/2 * Σ(y_i - (θ*x_i + b))^2`, with `θ` being the parameter vector [θ0, θ1], `b` a bias term, and `x_i` and `y_i` representing input data points and their respective labels.\n\nHow would you modify your SGD update rule to ensure it correctly accounts for both theta values (θ0 and θ1) at each iteration?\n\n**Solution Evaluation:**\nTo correct this, the update rule should involve partial derivatives with respect to `θ0` and `θ1`. This is known as the 'batch gradient descent' but in a stochastic context. Here's an example of how you might adjust it:\n\n`θ = θ - α * (1/m) * [ ∂J/∂θ0 * δ(i) + ∂J/∂θ1 * δ(i)]`, where `α` is the learning rate, `m` is the number of training examples, and `δ(i)` represents the correction for one training instance.\n\nThe partial derivatives with respect to theta0 and theta1 are:\n\n`∂J/∂θ0 = - Σ [(y_i - (θ0*x_i + b)) * x_i]`\n`∂J/∂θ1 = - Σ [(y_i - (θ0*x_i + b)) * x_i * i`\n\nSo, the full update rule would look like:\n\n`θ0 = θ0 - α * (1/m) * Σ [ -(y_i - (θ0*x_i + b)) * x_i ]`\n`θ1 = θ1 - α * (1/m) * Σ [ -(y_i - (θ0*x_i + b)) * x_i * i ]`\n\nAnd,\n\n`b = b - α * (1/m) * Σ [ -(y_i - (θ0*x_i + b)) ]`\n\nThis ensures that the adjustments to `θ0`, `θ1`, and `b` are computed correctly for each training instance.",

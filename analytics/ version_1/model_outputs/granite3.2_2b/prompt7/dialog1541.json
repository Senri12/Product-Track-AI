    "model_response": "As an exercise-focused coach, I primarily deal with fitness and training techniques. However, in this case, we can draw a parallel using the context of probability to spam words. Let's imagine that we have a hypothetical email system where words like 'prize' (приз) are often flagged as potential spam due to their high frequency in phishing emails or promotional content.\n\nThe likelihood (or 'probability') of a word like 'приз' appearing in legitimate, non-spam content would be relatively low compared to more common words such as 'the', 'and', 'a'. In an overly broad sense, let's say we're dealing with 100 emails for the sake of simplicity. If 'приз' appears in just one or two legitimate ones, then its spam probability might be close to 1 (or 100%).\n\nNow, if 'приз' is used frequently in non-spam content (perhaps in a more specific and contextual sense), let's say 5 times, then its spam probability would shift lower—approximately 2/6 or about 1/3. \n\nBut remember, this is a conceptual model and doesn't represent actual email filtering algorithms, which are sophisticated and use numerous factors to assess the authenticity of an email.\n\nTo solidify understanding, let's try a quiz:\n\n**Quiz Question:** If you found 'приз' in 3 out of 100 legitimate emails, what would be your estimated spam probability for this word?\n\nA) 2/5\nB) 1/4\nC) 3/10\nD) 1/3\n\n**Correct Answer:** D) 1/3\n\nPlease note that in real-world applications, such complex calculations are handled by advanced machine learning models and don't necessarily translate into a simple fraction based on appearances.",

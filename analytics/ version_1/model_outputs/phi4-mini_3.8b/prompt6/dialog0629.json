    "model_response": "Let's go through this step by step using a Socratic approach.\n\nFirstly, can you explain what is meant by \"learning rate decay\"? In the context of machine learning and neural networks training processes, it's typically used to decrease the value of the learning rate over time in order for convergence towards an optimal solution during backpropagation. As we progress through epochs (training iterations), it often helps with escaping local minima or slowdowns due to decreasing gradients.\n\nGiven parameters are:\n- Initial learning rate (\\(\\eta_0\\)) = 0.1\n- Time step \\(t\\) at which decay starts = 5th epoch, assuming counting from zero for simplicity.\n- Total epochs (T) = 10\n\nWe need a linear schedule of the learning rate as it decreases uniformly over time.\n\n**Steps to calculate learning rates:**\n\n1. Identify how long we have left after starting to apply decaying (\\(t - \\text{start}\\)).\n2. Determine by what fraction this remaining duration should be divided considering total epochs (T).\n3. Apply linear decay formula on the basis of initial and final values.\n\n**Linear Decay Formula:** \n\\[ η_t = η_0 + t' * m\\]\nwhere \\(η_t\\) is learning rate at time step \\(t\\), \\(\\eta_0\\) is starting value,  \\(m\\) represents decay slope which can be calculated as:\n\\[ m = (\\text{Final Learning Rate} - Initial Learning Rate)/T_{decay}\\]\n\nHere our Final Learning Rate after T epochs will ideally go down to zero in this context. Let's calculate the learning rate for each epoch:\n\n**Decay Slope (m):**\n\\[\nm = \\frac{\\eta_0 - 0}{10-5} = \\frac{0.1}{5} = 0.02\n\\]\n\nUsing Decay Formula:\n\\[ η_t = 0.1 + t' * m, where~t'= T-t+start\\\\= (T=t-T) \n\nCalculations for each epoch will be:\n\n**Initial Epochs:**\n\n- \\(η_1 = 0.1 - 0*(0.02)=0.10\\)\n- \\(η_2 = 0.1 + 1*-(0.02)=0.08 \\)\n\nContinue to calculate until T=10.\nResults would be:\n\n| Epoch | Learning Rate (η_t) |\n|-------|----------------------|\n|   5    |     ~0.01            |\n\nFinal learning rates across epochs can thus linearly decrement from initial value through a defined decay strategy.\n\nIn conclusion, our linear schedule for the given parameters will progressively reduce η starting at epoch T=0 with \\(\\eta_0 = 0.1\\) and gradually reaching zero by end of total time steps (T+10). Applying this ensures learning rate optimally adjusts over iterations to improve model convergence without overshooting minima points or stagnating prematurely.\n\nFeel free to ask more questions if clarity is required on any step!",

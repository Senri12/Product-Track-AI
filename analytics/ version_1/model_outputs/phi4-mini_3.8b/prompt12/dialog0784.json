    "model_response": "Key Points:\n\n1. Naive Bayes classifier is based upon applying Bayes theorem.\n2. It assumes that all features are independent of each other (hence \"naive\").\n3. It's particularly used for classification tasks and works well with categorical data.\n\nQuiz Questions: \n\na) Explain why the naive bayes classifier refers to as 'Naïve'?\nb) Can you mention any specific cases where this model is ideally suited?\n\nTargeted Question & Explanation:\n\nYou've mentioned that it assumes features are independent, but haven't elaborated on its implications. Remember in real-world scenarios rarely we find data points with a perfect independence of the variables; they often influence each other to some degree which can affect predictions accuracy. Can you think about any such examples?",

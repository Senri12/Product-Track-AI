    "model_response": "The formula to compute a decaying learning rate linearly over time is:\n\nη(t) = η0 + (t/T)*(ηmax - ηmin)\n\nwhere:\n- η(t) represents the learning rate at epoch 't'.\n- η0 denotes the initial learning rate.\n- t stands for the current training step or iteration number, which in this case we are considering as a fraction of total epochs T. Here it's given that you want to compute it after 5 iterations out of an assumed 10 (η(t) = 1/2 since you're at epoch halfway through), so we'll plug in t=0.5.\n- ηmax is the maximum learning rate, often set around values between 0 and 1 depending on your model's configuration; for simplicity we can assume this as a standard value of 1 (i.e., no decay).\n- T refers to total iterations or epochs here which equals 10.\n\nPlugging in these numbers:\n\nη(t) = η0 + t/T * (ηmax - ηmin)\n       = 0.1 + 0.5/1* (1 - 0)\n\nAssuming the learning rate decays linearly from its initial value to a minimum limit of zero, we can directly use this formula.\n\nSo,\n\nη(t) = 0.1 + 0.05 * (1-0)\n      = 0.15\n\nThis means at epoch halfway through after adjusting for linear decay your new learning rate would be approximately 0.15 assuming ηmax was set as a standard value of 1 in this example.\n\nWould you like to try with other values or further understand the parameters and their roles?",

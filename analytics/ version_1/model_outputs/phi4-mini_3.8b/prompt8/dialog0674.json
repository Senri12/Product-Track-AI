    "model_response": "The notation you've used (P(да | Пасмурно, Холодно, Влажно, Да)) appears to be an attempt at conditional probability in the context where 'да' means positive outcome and weather conditions are factors. However, there might be some confusion with notations or language translation involved.\n\nFirstly:\n- P(A|B) denotes \"the probability of A given B\".\n- It's important that both events (A as a positive result 'да', and B representing the set of circumstances such as weather being Passmuro, Coldly, Viously).\n\nSecondly,\n1. Clarify if you meant to calculate conditional probabilities with respect specifically to these environmental factors.\n2. Confirm whether we're working within certain statistical models or datasets that link this specific outcome (positive result 'да') directly and exclusively influenced by those conditions.\n\nSo it would help us understand the situation better:\n- Are we using real-life data where we've observed outcomes given particular weather states?\n- Or are you referring to an abstract model which describes these relationships?\n\nWith additional context, I can guide more accurately on what needs clarifying. Did this address your query properly?",

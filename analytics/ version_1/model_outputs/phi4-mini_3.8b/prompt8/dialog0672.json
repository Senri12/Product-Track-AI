    "model_response": "First, let's clarify that Euclidean distance is calculated using a formula derived from Pythagoras' theorem: d = √[(x₂ - x₁)^2 + (y₂ - y_y)^2]. In this case:\n\n- x₁ and y₁ are the coordinates of point 1 which correspond to 1,2.\n- X₂ and Y₂ refer to those for Point 2 as 3,4.\n\nPlugging in values into formula: d = √[(3-1)² + (4-2)²] = √[4+4] = √8 = approximately 2.83 units.\n\n\nI hope this clears up any confusion! Could you confirm that you've understood the calculation of Euclidean distance?",

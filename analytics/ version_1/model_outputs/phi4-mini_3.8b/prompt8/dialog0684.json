    "model_response": "The Newton method is an iterative technique used to find successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function. It begins with an initial guess at which it iterates by applying certain mathematical rules derived from calculus, specifically using derivatives.\n\nHowever, before we proceed further into explaining its applications and how it's implemented in detail — would you like me just to reiterate this basic definition for clarity or is there something more specific about the Newton method that you're interested in learning?",

It is important that we clarify their level of experience with machine learning, as it can significantly impact our explanation. For someone new:\n\n\n\"Can you tell me what your familiarity or previous knowledge regarding 'k-NN', which stands for K-Nearest Neighbors in the context of data science and pattern recognition techniques? This will help us tailor an appropriate response that aligns to a beginner's understanding level.\"",

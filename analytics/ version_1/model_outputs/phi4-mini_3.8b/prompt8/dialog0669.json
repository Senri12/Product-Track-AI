    "model_response": "When considering how to classify an email as spam using the Naive Bayes classifier, there are a few key questions we need clarification on:\n\n1. Do you have labeled data that includes examples of both 'spam' and 'ham' (non-spam) emails?\n2. Are all features relevant for classification extracted from these messages? Features can include word frequencies or presence/absence indicators.\n3. Have any preprocessing steps like tokenization, removal of stop words, stemming, etc., been applied to the text data?\n\nOnce we have answers that clarify your current situation with respect to spam detection using Naive Bayes:\n\n- If you understand and agree on these points but need further clarification or assistance in applying them practically (e.g., coding a simple model), please let me know so I can help accordingly.",

    "model_response": "A 'learning rate' refers to how quickly or slowly an AI model adjusts its parameters—essentially determining weight adjustments after each iteration during training.\n\nIn simpler terms: Imagine you're trying to hit a target; your success depends on both the skill (your current knowledge) and consistency of practice. The \"learning rate\" can be thought as measuring one's step size towards hitting that goal, controlling how much you adjust with every attempt or 'practice' session.\n\n\nDo we need any clarifications here? Do you have questions about what learning rates mean in specific contexts like neural networks training processes?",

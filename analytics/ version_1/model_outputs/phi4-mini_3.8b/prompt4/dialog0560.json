    "model_response": "SGD stands for Stochastic Gradient Descent.\n\nIn simpler words: Imagine you're trying to find your way through foggy forest blindfolded using a stick as guidance (stick being equivalent of learning). Instead of taking one giant step forward, you randomly take small steps in different directions and adjust them based on what sticks dig into the ground. Over time with many iterations or trials - each \"random\" trial helps guide better to your destination faster.\n\nIn terms of machine learning, SGD is an optimization algorithm used for finding optimal parameters (weights) while building a model from scratch step by step using available data sample and adjusting itself continuously as it learns more samples rather than trying all at once. This allows the models trained with this method can generalize better in real-world scenarios.\n\nRemember it's quite effective but also needs careful tuning to avoid getting stuck or slow convergence on learning new patterns! Good luck exploring this exciting world of machine learning optimization techniques - you're doing great just starting out!",

    "model_response": "Hello! I'm glad you're interested in learning about Euclidean distance—that's just a fancy name for how far apart two points are on this kind of flat space we call \"the plane.\"\n\n\nLet's look at our example. We have these coordinates: the first point is (1,2), and you can think of it like standing 1 step right from your starting position in an invisible grid that goes across a field or hallway—the 'x' axis—and another vertical line up—called the 'y' axis.\n\nThe second coordinate we are looking at here is (3,4). So now imagine stepping three steps to the side and four spaces forward along our imaginary axes.\n\n\nTo calculate how far apart these two points actually stand from each other on this plane without climbing a hill or going through water—we'll stick with simple distance—it's like measuring straight across in an open field. We use Euclidean Distance, which is essentially finding out \"how many steps\" you'd need to walk directly between them.\n\n\nHere's the formula for it:\n\nDistance = √((x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²)\n\n\nLet's plug our numbers into this equation: \n\n(x1,y1) = (1, 2), and \n(x2,y2) = (3, 4).\n\n\nOur calculation will look like:\n\n\nDistance = √((3-1)² + (4-2)²)\n\n= √(2² + 2²)\n\n= √(4+4)\n\n= √8\n\n≈ 2.83 steps\n\n\nSo it would take you approximately about two and a third straight-line distance to walk from point one, if we could really count this way in our grid-field! Great job following along with me on understanding Euclidean Distance—you're doing great learning these concepts!",

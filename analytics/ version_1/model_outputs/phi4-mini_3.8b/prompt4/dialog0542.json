    "model_response": "Hello! I understand that you're trying to grasp how many neighbors (k) you should consider when using K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm for classification or regression tasks.\n\nChoosing 'k' can indeed be a bit challenging, as it plays an important role in the performance of your model. Here's some simple guidance on selecting k:\n\n1. Small value: A small number like 1 means you're looking at only one neighbor to make predictions.\n2. Large values might overfit and learn noise or patterns from training data.\n\nA good starting point is using 'k' = 5, as it's a common choice that tends to work well in many situations without being too sensitive for most datasets (though this isn't always the best option). \n\nYou can experiment with different k-values; keep track of your results. Lower values will lead to more complex models and higher chances for overfitting.\n\nRemember! Don't forget positive feedback on trying new things - it's part exploration, not just about reaching a perfect answer right away but discovering what works in this context best!\n\nI hope you understand better now how choosing k affects the K-NN algorithm. Keep experimenting with different values to see which one performs well for your dataset and problem-solving!",

    "model_response": "Overfitting occurs when your machine learning model learns not only from features but also memorizes them to an extent that it negatively impacts its ability to generalize upon seeing new data points.\n\nWhen a statistical or estimation method is applied repeatedly with different datasets of the same distribution, under certain conditions (e.g., assuming fixed variance), this procedure becomes consistent. In most cases where you are estimating parameters in many situations such as linear regression and logistic regressions; if your sample size grows larger it will converge to its true value.\n\nIn general terms overfitting occurs when there is excessive training of the machine learning model resulting from a multitude of variables being involved, this makes prediction for new data extremely difficult. A common method used in avoiding problems related with underfitting and overfitting are cross-validation techniques such as K-fold Cross-Validation which partitions your dataset into smaller subsets to test against each other.\n\nA simple strategy is dividing the input set X (training examples) randomly into two parts, called training subset Xt and validation subset Xu. The learning algorithm's task during this phase would be to learn a function f(x). However its accuracy will not only depend on how well it fits with x in t but also which are better hypotheses that fit data y ∼ p(y|x,t).\n\nA good rule of thumb is when you split the dataset into training and validation sets, 70% for one set (training) while reserving around 30-35% as a separate test set. The remaining portion serves to evaluate how well your model learned from X.\n\nWhen we have many features that can potentially contribute in learning this function f(x), it is highly likely the best hypothesis will not be an obvious choice, hence creating issues for identifying overfitting or underfitting models which leads us into performing a grid search. \n\nA good idea would consist of starting off with less complex model like linear regression as opposed to using more advanced techniques such as neural networks since they can have millions even billions parameters that are not learned directly from the original data.\n\nUltimately, it is essential for you always start by building an accurate learning function in a simpler way first before progressing onto any larger scale. Once your accuracy has been improved significantly on x values then moving to y will become much easier as well. \n\nIf after these checks there still remains uncertainty of whether overfitting or underfitting the model, one can consider looking into advanced techniques such as boosting which takes different weights with each subset for better predictions.\n\nRemember that even though we may think we've achieved a good fit on training data it doesn't guarantee achieving similar results in real-world situations. As much as possible try to avoid memorizing datasets instead focusing more towards learning from them through various methods discussed above while ensuring not overfitting your model which would hurt the performance significantly when encountering new unseen inputs.",

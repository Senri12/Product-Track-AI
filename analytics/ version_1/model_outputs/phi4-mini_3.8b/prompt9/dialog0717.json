    "model_response": "### Explanation\nIn momentum optimization during neural network training:\n\nv_t = (α * v_{t-1}) + ((1 - α) * ∂L/∂w)\n\nWhere:\n- γ is the decay rate for velocity updates.\n- v_{t-1} is the previous value of the gradient descent's learning parameter, here denoted as momentum or simply 'momentum'.\n- η (eta) represents a small constant to control step size in traditional Gradient Descent but not directly used with Momentum. Instead, we use γ which controls how much weight given velocity takes compared to current gradients.\n- ∂L/∂w is the gradient of loss L concerning weights.\n\nSince v_t = momentum and α (alpha) usually denotes learning rate for GD; it's replaced by decay factor γ in this context.\n\n\n### Question for Student\nGiven that we have no direct learning rate, how can you derive the updated value 'v_t' using Momentum with a decaying parameter of 0.9 when previous velocity v_{t-1} = 1 and gradient ∂L/∂w is given as 2?\n\n### Suggested Exercise\nCalculate `v_t` by substituting γ=0.9, momentum term (previous) value v_{t-1}=1 with the current loss's derivative of L being ∇L=2.\n\n```plaintext\nUse formula: v_t = α * v_{t-1} + ((1 - α) * ∂L/∂w)\nReplace α by γ for Momentum context.\n```\n\n### Feedback Loop\n\nCalculate `v_t`:\n\nv_t = (0.9 * 1) + ((1 - 0.9) * 2)\n\nLet's break this down:\n- The first part of the equation: v_{t-1} multiplied with learning rate decay, γ=0.9.\n- Second part considers new gradients' weight after accounting for previous velocities.\n\nv_t = (0.9 * 1) + ((0.1) * 2)\n\nv_t = 0.9 + 0.2\n\nv_t = 1.1",

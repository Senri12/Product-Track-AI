    "model_response": "**Explanation:** \n\nTo find the distance between two points in Euclidean space with coordinates \\( P_1(x_1,y_1) \\) and \\( P_2(x_2,y_2) \\), we use the Distance Formula: \n\\[ d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}.\\]\n\n**Question for Student:** \n\nWhat are the coordinates of points given in your task? How would you apply them to find their distance using Euclidean geometry?\n\n**Suggested Exercise:**\n\nUse the Distance Formula with these steps:\n- Identify \\( x_1 = 1, y_1 = 2 \\) and \\( x_2 = 3, y_2 = 4 \\).\n- Substitute into formula.\n- Compute squares of differences for both coordinates (\\((x_2 - x_1)^2\\) and \\((y_2 - y_1)^2)\\), sum them up then take the square root to find distance.\n\n**Feedback Loop:**\n\nUpon completing your calculation, compare it with my computation. If there are discrepancies in answers (I should arrive at a result of 2.82842712474619...), discuss possible mistakes and reinforce correct methods for using coordinates within Euclidean geometry calculations.",

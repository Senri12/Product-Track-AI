    "model_response": "**Explanation**\nKeras is an open-source neural network library written in Python that was designed to enable fast experimentation with deep learning algorithms through a simple interface but also offers flexibility when more control over model architecture or training process is needed.\n\n**Question for Student:**\n- Can you list two key features of Keras?\n\n**Suggested Exercise:**\n- Try setting up your first neural network using the Sequential API in Keras. Define at least one layer and compile it with an optimizer, loss function, and metric that would be suitable to predict a simple dataset.\n\n**Feedback Loop:**\nAs students progress through exercises like this they should receive timely feedback on their implementation choices for defining layers as well as compiling models appropriately based upon the given task's requirements.",

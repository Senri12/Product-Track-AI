    "model_response": "**Explanation:** RMSProp stands for Root Mean Square Propagation. It is an adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm designed specifically to address problems with noisy or sparse gradients in neural networks.\n\nRMSProp modifies traditional gradient descent methods by adjusting each parameter's update steps according to the magnitude of its recent history, which helps stabilize and accelerate convergence during training complex models like deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for tasks such as image classification. It achieves this through an exponentially weighted moving average of squared gradients that informs how much we should adjust our parameters at any given time.\n\n**Question for Student:** How does RMSProp differ from traditional gradient descent methods, and why is it particularly useful in training deep learning models?\n\n**Suggested Exercise:** Implement a simple neural network using TensorFlow or PyTorch. Experiment with both standard Gradient Descent (or SGD) optimization as well as the RMSProp optimizer to compare their performance on your chosen dataset.\n\n1. Initialize parameters for input data X, labels Y.\n2. Define model architecture and forward pass functions.\n3. Apply Cross-Entropy loss function suitable for classification tasks.\n4. Train using both optimizers: Gradient Descent (SGD) first; then RMSProp second - noting down the differences in learning curves.\n\n**Feedback Loop:** Review your results focusing on:\n1. Training time convergence\n2. Stability during training, especially with large gradients typical of deep neural networks \n3. Model performance accuracy after reaching an acceptable loss level\n\nCompare and contrast both optimizers' behavior by discussing how RMSProp's adaptive approach might have led to faster or more stable learning compared against the traditional Gradient Descent method used initially. This hands-on experience will help you understand why certain algorithms are preferred over others in specific scenarios, especially when dealing with noisy gradients that often arise during deep neural network training.",

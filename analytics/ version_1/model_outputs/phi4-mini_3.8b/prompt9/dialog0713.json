    "model_response": "**Explanation:** Learning rate is an important hyperparameter in machine learning that determines how quickly or slowly our model learns from data during training.\n\n- **Question for Student:** Can you explain why adjusting the learning rate might be necessary when you're working with a neural network?\n  \n- **Suggested Exercise:** Experiment by setting different values of learning rates (e.g., 0.01, 0.001) in your machine learning code and observe how it affects training time and model performance.\n\n- **Feedback Loop:**\n    - If the chosen value is too high or low:\n      - High Learning Rate: Model may converge quickly but could overshoot optimal weights leading to poor accuracy.\n      - Low Learning Rate: Training takes longer, might be stuck in local minima making convergence slow without reaching a good solution.",

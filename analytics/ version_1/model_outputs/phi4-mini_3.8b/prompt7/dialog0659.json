    "model_response": "Learning Rate Decay is used in machine learning to decrease the value of learning rates as training progresses which can improve convergence during optimization.\n\nThe formula for Linear Learning Rate Decay:\n\nη_t = η_0 * (T - t) / T\n\nwhere:\n- η_t: Learning rate at epoch 't'\n- η_0: Initial learning rate\n- T: Total number of epochs\n- t: Current training iteration or epoch\n\n\nGiven your parameters, here's how you would calculate the Decayed Learning Rate:\n\nη_t = 0.1 * (10 - 5) / 10\n\nNow we'll plug in the values and solve for η_t.\n\n\nη_t = 0.1 * 5 / 10\n\nη_t = 0.05\n\n\nSo, at epoch t=5 with a total of T=10 epochs starting from an initial learning rate (η_0) of 0.1 using linear decay strategy, the new learning rate would be η_t = 0.05.\n\n\nPractice Problem:\n\nGiven η₀=0.2 and after completing 20 out of 50 training iterations with a total epoch count T=100, what will be your decayed learning rate? Calculate it assuming you are still using linear decay strategy.\n\n(Answer: The new learning rate would be calculated as follows):\n\nη_t = 0.2 * (100 - 20) / 100\n\nη_t = 0.16",

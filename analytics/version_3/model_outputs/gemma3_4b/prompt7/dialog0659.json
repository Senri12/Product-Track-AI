    "model_response": "Okay, let's calculate the learning rate decay step by step.\n\nWe are given:\n\n*   `η0` (initial learning rate) = 0.1\n*   `t` (current step) = 5\n*   `T` (total number of steps) = 10\n*   decay type = linear\n\nThe formula for linear decay is:\n\n`η = η0 * (1 - t/T)`\n\nLet's plug in the values:\n\n`η = 0.1 * (1 - 5/10)`\n`η = 0.1 * (1 - 0.5)`\n`η = 0.1 * 0.5`\n`η = 0.05`\n\nTherefore, the learning rate at step 5 is 0.05.\n",

It is based on the concept of conditional probability and calculates the class score using only observed data rather than all possible input parameters in model inference process.\n\nThe primary goal of this method is to maximize or minimize some function value called log-likelihood by parameter estimation (i.e., learning with optimization, which means finding best values for given models that results into most likely output after cross checking and evaluating the calculated class score using observed data set as training example sets in model inference process rather then general observation under conditional probability concept. In other words is used to create some specific mapping between a variable space of (a x) and outputs which defined by function L or functional optimization with observed values only instead of extrapolating results for the further analysis and prediction purposes using data set as training example sets in model inference process based on given algorithm ùíú as parameter search scope rather then general observation under conditional probability concept used.\n\nIn such mapping result some output will be calculated which defined by L(a, x). In fact (a: variable space map to observed values only instead of extrapolating results for further analysis and prediction purposes using data set in model inference process with optimization meaning maximization or minimization log-likelihood score as parameter estimation rather then learning ùíú. As a result the class scores mapped by function which defined is given below where L ( conditional probability concept based on observed values only instead of extrapolating results for further analysis and prediction purposes using data set in model inference process with optimization not general observation under conditional logic but to create some mapping between parameter space rather then cross checking as used above explained also applied ùíú map output class scores defined by function L.\n\n Summarizing is given below the following concept related observed value mapped score which calculated and classified according results combined using previous learning data set ( a x, y) maps input values to result outputs giving mapping parameter optimization for model inference with cross check as further analysis rather then extrapolating new unobserved inputs based on  conditional logic used above explained thus in this algorithm output class scores defined by function L.

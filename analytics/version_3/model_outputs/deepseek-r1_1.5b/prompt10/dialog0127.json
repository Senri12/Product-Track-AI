    "model_response": "В our Naive Bayes model, вероятность класса нового примера можно рассчитать следующим образом:\n\nДля каждого класса k, our learned distributions probabilities probability features (X1, X2, ..., Xp) for each class are calculated. Then, for a new example with attributes x1, x2, ..., xp, the posterior probability P(k | x1, x2, ..., xp) is computed as the product of the likelihoods and the prior probability:\n\nP(k | x1, x2, ..., xp) = P(x1, x2, ..., xp | k) / P(x1, x2, ..., xp)\n\nWhere:\n- P(x1, x2, ..., xp | k) is the joint distribution for features given class k (assumed independent by Naive Bayes)\n- P(k) is the prior probability of class k\n- P(x1, x2, ..., xp) is the evidence\n\nThis approach allows our model to make predictions based on the learned distributions and assumes independence between features. Despite this simplification, it often performs well in practice when features are relatively independent given classes.",

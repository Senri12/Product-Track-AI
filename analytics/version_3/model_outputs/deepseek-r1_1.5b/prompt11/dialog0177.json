    "model_response": "Momentum accelerates gradient descent by considering past gradients, helping converge faster and escape saddle points. The update formula is:\n\nv_t = γ * v_{t-1} - η * ∇L(θ_{t-1})\n\nWhere:\n- γ (0 < γ < 1) is the momentum coefficient.\n- θ_{t-1} is the parameter vector at step t-1.\n- ∇L(θ_{t-1}) is the gradient of the loss function.\n\nThis method helps stabilize training by smoothing out oscillations caused by shallow minima.",

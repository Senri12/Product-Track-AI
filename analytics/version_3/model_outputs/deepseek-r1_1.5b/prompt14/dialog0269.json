    "model_response": "Learning Rate Decay Linear (η₀ = 0.1, t = 5, T = 10): \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Initial Learning Rate (η₀):**\n   η₀ = 0.1\n\n2. **Total Training Steps (T):**\n   T = 10\n\n3. **Number of Steps Considered for Decay (t):**\n   t = 5\n\n4. **Decay Rate (α):**\n   Calculate the decay rate α as t / T:\n   α = t / T = 5 / 10 = 0.5\n\n5. **Learning Rate at Step t (ηₜ):**\n   ηₜ = η₀ * (1 - α)^t\n   Plugging in the values:\n   η₅ = 0.1 * (1 - 0.5)^5 = 0.1 * (0.5)^5 = 0.1 * 0.032768 ≈ 0.0032768\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe learning rate decays by a factor of 0.5 after each step for the first 5 steps. This means that starting from an initial learning rate of 0.1, the rate reduces to approximately 0.0032768 at step 5.\n\nAnswer:\nη₅ = 0.0032768",

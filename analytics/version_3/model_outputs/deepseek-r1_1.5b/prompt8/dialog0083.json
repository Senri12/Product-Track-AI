    "model_response": "Learning rate — это параметр, который управляет скоростью обучения в нейронных сетях. Основное значение Learning Rate — это параметр, который controlsthow quickly network learns from data. \n\nLarger learning rates mean that network learn faster. But sometimes, large LR can jump over the minimum of loss function and miss it. Smaller learning rates may get stuck in local minima instead. Also, using Momentum (Adam) can help to speed up convergence and escape local minima.\n\nAnother way to think about Learning Rate is that it's how much we update our weights based on the gradient of the loss function during backpropagation. If Learning Rate is too large, you may overshoot the minimum. If it's too small, you might just oscillate around it or get stuck in a local minimum.\n\nTo find optimal Learning Rate, one can perform grid search between different LR values and use validation data to check how well model performs on unseen data.",

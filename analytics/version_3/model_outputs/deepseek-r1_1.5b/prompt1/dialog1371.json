    "model_response": "Momentum, as used in optimization algorithms like Adam, is a technique designed to accelerate the convergence of gradient descent methods. It involves accumulating velocity or moving past the gradient more quickly by considering previous gradients and parameter updates. This can help escape local minima and speed up learning. In simpler terms, Momentum \"stalls\" slowly but accumulates momentum from past steps, allowing for faster movement in the optimization direction. This method is particularly effective in scenarios where traditional gradient descent methods struggle due to slow convergence or oscillation.\n\nIn the context of Keras optimizers, Momentum likely refers to a specific implementation within the Adam optimizer that incorporates this acceleration technique. The exact mechanism involves maintaining moving averages of gradients and parameters, which helps balance exploration and exploitation during training. Implementing Momentum in an optimizer typically requires adjusting certain parameters, such as the momentum coefficient, which controls the weight given to past gradients.\n\nUnderstanding the impact of momentum on convergence depends on how much acceleration is needed for your specific model. Increasing the momentum can speed up learning but may lead to instability. Conversely, decreasing it might reduce stability. Setting it appropriately is key to achieving optimal training performance.",

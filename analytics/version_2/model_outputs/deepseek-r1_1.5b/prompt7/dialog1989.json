    "model_response": "To classify emails as spam using Naive Bayes, follow these organized steps:\n\n### 1. **Feature Extraction**\n   - **Extract Features**: Identify word frequency or presence features such as:\n     - Number of words\n     - Frequency of common words (e.g., 'the', 'is')\n     - Frequency of less common words\n     - Presence of specific keywords like 'free,' 'offer'\n   - **Preprocess**: Convert all text to lowercase and remove punctuation.\n\n### 2. **Class Labeling**\n   - Clearly define whether an email is spam or not based on context.\n\n### 3. **Training the Model**\n   - Use Naive Bayes algorithm with extracted features.\n   - Calculate conditional probabilities P(feature | class) for each feature given the class (spam/not spam).\n\n### 4. **Evaluation**\n   - Split emails into training and test sets.\n   - Predict email classes using Naive Bayes based on features.\n   - Assess performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, etc.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile Naive Bayes is simple due to its independence assumption, it can serve as a foundational approach for more complex models. By carefully selecting relevant features and evaluating their impact, you can build an effective spam classification system.",

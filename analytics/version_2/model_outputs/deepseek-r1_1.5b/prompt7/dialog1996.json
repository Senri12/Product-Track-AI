    "model_response": "Automated Differentiation (autograd) is a technique within PyTorch used for computing gradients during backpropagation. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Forward Propagation**: During forward propagation, the input data flows through a network to produce an output.\n\n2. **Gradient Calculation with Autograd**:\n    - autograd automatically computes the derivatives of the outputs with respect to all the inputs (gradients).\n    - It does this by first computing intermediate values during forward propagation.\n    - For each layer, it records how changes in the input affect the layer's output (forward pass).\n\n3. **Backpropagation**: Autograd is used alongside PyTorch's backward propagation mechanism, where gradients are computed step by step through layers.\n\n4. **Efficiency**:\n    - autograd avoids manually computing gradients by using automatic differentiation.\n    - It optimizes the computation of gradients in neural networks during backpropagation.\n\nIn summary, autograd facilitates efficient and accurate gradient computation in neural networks by automatically calculating derivatives through forward propagation and then propagating those gradients backward during backpropagation.",

    "model_response": "To calculate the probability of a class in a Naive Bayes classifier, follow these structured steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Prior Probabilities (P(Class))**:\n   - Count the number of samples in each class from your training data.\n   - Divide each count by the total number of samples to obtain the prior probability for each class.\n\n2. **Estimate Likelihoods (P(Feature | Class))**:\n   - For each feature and each class:\n     - If the feature is continuous, model its distribution using a suitable method like Gaussian distribution.\n     - If the feature is categorical, count occurrences of each category within the class.\n\n3. **Compute Evidence (P(Feature))**:\n   - Sum over all classes for each feature: P(Class) * P(Feature | Class)\n   - This gives the total probability of observing the feature across all classes.\n\n4. **Apply Bayes' Theorem**:\n   For a new data sample with features \\( F_1, F_2, \\dots, F_n \\):\n   - Compute the likelihood for each feature given its class.\n   - Multiply each likelihood by the prior probability of the class.\n   - Sum these weighted probabilities across all classes and divide by the total evidence to get the posterior probability of the class.\n\nThis approach leverages the Naive Bayes assumption of feature independence, providing a practical method for classification while requiring sufficient data and balanced class representation.",

    "model_response": "To calculate the probability of a class in a Naive Bayes model, follow these simplified steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Prior Probabilities**: \n   - For each class k (1 to C), compute P(class = k) as:\n     \\[\n     P(k) = \\frac{\\text{count}(k)}{N}\n     \\]\n     Where count(k) is the number of instances in your training set belonging to class k, and N is the total number of instances.\n\n2. **Compute Conditional Probabilities**: \n   - For each feature value f and class k, compute P(f | class = k). This represents how likely a particular feature is given that it belongs to class k.\n\n3. **Apply Bayes' Theorem**:\n   - For an instance with features \\( f_1, f_2, ..., f_n \\), the probability for each class k is proportional to:\n     \\[\n     P(class = k | features) \\propto P(k) \\times P(f_1 | k) \\times P(f_2 | k) \\times ... \\times P(f_n | k)\n     \\]\n\n4. **Predict the Class**:\n   - Select the class with the highest product of probabilities as the predicted class for that instance.\n\nThis method leverages the independence assumption between features given the class to simplify complex joint probability calculations, making Naive Bayes a computationally efficient and effective classifier.",

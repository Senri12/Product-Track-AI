    "model_response": "In the context of optimization within machine learning, \"Momentum\" refers to a technique that incorporates past gradient information into the current gradient during each training step. This approach helps in navigating the loss landscape more smoothly by preventing oscillations, which can occur when updating parameters based on gradient values alone.\n\nMathematically, momentum is often represented using parameters β1 and β2, commonly used in algorithms like Adam. β1 decays exponentially the average of gradients over time, while β2 maintains a moving average of squared gradients. This method allows each layer's gradient to be remembered from previous steps, contributing to more stable and efficient parameter updates.\n\nIn summary, momentum in optimization techniques leverages past information to guide current updates, enhancing convergence speed and stability by smoothing out fluctuations in the learning process.",

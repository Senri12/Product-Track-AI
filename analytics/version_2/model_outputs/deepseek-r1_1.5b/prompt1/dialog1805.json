    "model_response": "Laplace smoothing, also known as additive smoothing, is a technique used to prevent issues like zero probabilities in probabilistic models such as language models. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Addition of Smoothing Constant**: To each count of words in the training data (including those not seen before), add a small constant value. This ensures that no word has a probability of zero.\n\n2. **Adjusting Probabilities**: After adding the smoothing constant, all counts are divided by the total number of words across all contexts and smoothing constants. This adjustment accounts for unseen words uniformly.\n\n3. **Robustness to Unseen Words**: Laplace smoothing adjusts each word's probability based on its frequency within all contexts. This makes the model more robust to unseen words as they are given some probability mass through their context counts.\n\n**Formula Explanation**:\n- Let \\( count(c:w_i) \\) be the count of word \\( w_i \\) in n-gram context \\( c \\).\n- Add a smoothing constant \\( α \\) (e.g., 1) to each count: \\( adjusted\\_count(c:w_i) = count(c:w_i) + α \\).\n- Compute the total adjusted count across all words and contexts.\n- The probability \\( P(w|c) \\) is then given by:\n  \\[\n  P(w|c) = \\frac{adjusted\\_count(c:w)}{\\text{total adjusted count} + α}\n  \\]\n\n**Conclusion**:\nLaplace smoothing ensures that every word has some probability mass, preventing zero probabilities and reducing overfitting. It does this by uniformly adding a constant to all counts, including those for unseen words, adjusting each context's probability accordingly.",

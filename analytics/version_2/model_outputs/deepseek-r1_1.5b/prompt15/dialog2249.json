    "model_response": "To compute the learning rate decay using linear decay over 10 training steps with an initial learning rate (η₀) of 0.1 and applying decay for 5 steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total decrease needed per step:**\n   - Total decrease = η₀ - (T / T) * η₀ = 0\n   - This implies that each step decreases by a fixed amount, which may result in some steps having zero learning rate.\n\n2. **Distribute the decay over the steps for t=1 to t=5:**\n   - η_t = η₀ - (t / T) * η₀\n   - Step 1: 0.1 - (1/10)*0.1 = 0.09\n   - Step 2: 0.09 - (2/10)*0.1 = 0.07\n   - Step 3: 0.07 - (3/10)*0.1 = 0.04\n   - Step 4: 0.04 - (4/10)*0.1 = 0.00\n\n3. **Final Learning Rates for Each Step:**\n   - Step 1: 0.09\n   - Step 2: 0.07\n   - Step 3: 0.04\n   - Step 4: 0.00 (no further decay)\n   - Steps 5-10: Learning rate remains at η₀ = 0.1\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nFor t=1 to t=5, the learning rates are:\n- t=1: 0.09\n- t=2: 0.07\n- t=3: 0.04\n- t=4: 0.00\n- t≥5: 0.1",

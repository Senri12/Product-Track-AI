    "model_response": "The **Newton-Raphson method** is an iterative numerical technique used to find successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function. It uses the function's derivative at each step to make linear approximations, converging quickly to the root when the initial guess is sufficiently close.\n\nHere's a concise explanation:\n\n1. **Initial Guess**: Start with an initial guess \\( x_0 \\) close to the actual root.\n2. **Linear Approximation**: At \\( x_0 \\), approximate the function \\( f(x) \\) using its tangent line:\n   \\[\n   y = f(x_0) + f'(x_0)(x - x_0)\n   \\]\n3. **Find Intersection**: Set \\( y = 0 \\) to find where the tangent intersects the x-axis, giving a new estimate:\n   \\[\n   x_1 = x_0 - \\frac{f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)}\n   \\]\n4. **Iterate**: Repeat the process with \\( x_1 \\) until the estimates converge to the root.\n\n**Why it Works**:\nThe method leverages linear approximation near each guess, making it efficient and reliable for many functions where derivatives are easy to compute. Each iteration reduces the error by a factor squared, leading to rapid convergence.\n\n**Considerations**:\n- Requires \\( f'(x) \\) to exist and be continuous around the root.\n- Can handle multiple roots but may require different initial guesses each time.\n- Suitable when derivative information is readily available, making it powerful for problems where derivatives are computationally expensive or non-existent.",

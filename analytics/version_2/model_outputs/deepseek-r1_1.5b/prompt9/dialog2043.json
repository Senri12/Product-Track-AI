    "model_response": "**Это euclidean metric — это какая-то метрика на пространстве Euclidова геометрии.**\n\n**Euclidean metric Formula:**  \ndistance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) equals √[(x2-x1)² + (y2-y1)²].\n\n**Examples of euclidean metric:**\n- In machine learning for k-means clustering.\n- In geospatial data analysis for distance calculations on Earth's surface.\n\n**Application in various areas:**  \nEuclidean metric is a standard tool in geometry, physics, and computer science. It serves as a foundational concept for further studies like topology and differential geometry.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe euclidean metric provides a straightforward way to measure distances in Euclidean space, which is essential across numerous fields including mathematics, physics, engineering, and machine learning.",

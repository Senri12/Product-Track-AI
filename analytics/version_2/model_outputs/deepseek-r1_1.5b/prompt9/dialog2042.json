    "model_response": "To select the number of neighbors (k) in a k-NN algorithm, follow these structured steps:\n\n1. **Cross-Validation**: Use techniques like leave-one-out or 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate different values of k. This ensures a robust assessment across various subsets of data.\n\n2. **Optimal k Determination**: Identify the k that minimizes validation error. Plotting training and validation metrics against k can reveal the optimal balance between bias and variance, preventing overfitting or underfitting.\n\n3. **Computational Considerations**: Balance computational efficiency with model performance. Lower k values may increase computational load, while higher k values could slow down the process as more neighbors are considered.\n\n4. **Distance Metrics**: Choose a suitable distance metric that aligns with your data structure, optimizing for accuracy and relevance to the problem at hand.\n\n5. **Experimentation and Validation**: Experiment with different k values using appropriate metrics. Consider employing LOOCV if your dataset is small, ensuring computational efficiency without excessive variance.\n\nBy systematically applying these steps, you can select an optimal k that enhances model performance while maintaining generalizability.",

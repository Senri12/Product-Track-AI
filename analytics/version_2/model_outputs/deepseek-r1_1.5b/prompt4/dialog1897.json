    "model_response": "To calculate the probability that a class \\( C \\) occurs given features \\( F_1, F_2, \\ldots, F_n \\) using Naive Bayes, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Compute Likelihoods**: For each feature \\( F_i \\), compute the likelihood \\( P(F_i | C) \\), which is the probability of observing feature \\( F_i \\) given class \\( C \\).\n\n2. **Multiply Likelihoods**: Multiply all the likelihoods for features given the class to get the joint likelihood:\n   \\[\n   P(F_1, F_2, \\ldots, F_n | C) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} P(F_i | C)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Compute Prior Probability**: Calculate \\( P(C) \\), the prior probability of class \\( C \\).\n\n4. **Calculate Posterior Probability**: Using Bayes' Theorem:\n   \\[\n   P(C | F_1, F_2, \\ldots, F_n) = \\frac{P(F_1, F_2, \\ldots, F_n | C) \\times P(C)}{P(F_1, F_2, \\ldots, F_n)}\n   \\]\n   where \\( P(F_1, F_2, \\ldots, F_n) \\) is the marginal likelihood for all features.\n\n5. **Normalization**: Ensure that the sum of posterior probabilities across all classes equals 1 by normalizing if necessary.\n\n**Key Points:**\n- **Naive Assumption**: Assumes features are independent given a class.\n- **Handling Classes with Fewer Observations**: Use Laplace smoothing or additive smoothing to avoid zero probabilities.\n- **Practical Application**: Each feature contributes multiplicatively, and the result is proportional to \\( P(C) \\times \\prod P(F_i | C) \\).\n\n**Example:**\nFor emails classified as spam (class A):\n- \\( P(\\text{'free' | A}) = 0.3 \\)\n- \\( P(\\text{'money' | A}) = 0.4 \\)\n- Joint likelihood for an email with 'free' and 'money': \\( 0.3 \\times 0.4 = 0.12 \\)\n\nFor emails classified as non-spam (class B):\n- \\( P(\\text{'free' | B}) = 0.5 \\)\n- \\( P(\\text{'money' | B}) = 0.6 \\)\n- Joint likelihood: \\( 0.5 \\times 0.6 = 0.30 \\)\n\nThe posterior probability for class A is proportional to 0.12, and for class B, it's proportional to 0.30.\n\n**Final Answer**: The probability that a class \\( C \\) occurs given features \\( F_1, F_2, \\ldots, F_n \\) using Naive Bayes is calculated by multiplying the likelihoods of each feature for class \\( C \\), multiplying by the prior probability of class \\( C \\), and normalizing appropriately. This results in a posterior probability proportional to the product of individual likelihoods.\n\n\\[\nP(C | F_1, F_2, \\ldots, F_n) \\propto P(F_1 | C) \\times P(F_2 | C) \\times \\cdots \\times P(F_n | C) \\times P(C)\n\\]",

    "model_response": "Расстояние Чебышё夫 — это one metric in mathematics. 它 описывает, какFarthest between two points.  \n\nЧebyshev distance 米кроformulates distance as the maximum of the absolute differences between coordinates of corresponding elements. Imagine you have two points in n-dimensional space. Each point is represented by a set of coordinates (x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ) and (y₁, y₂, ..., yₙ). The Chebyshev distance between these points is the largest difference among all the corresponding coordinates.\n\nFor example, if you have two points A = (2, 3) and B = (5, 7), then the differences are |5-2| = 3 and |7-3| = 4. The Chebyshev distance between them is max(3, 4) = 4.\n\nКажется, это понятно?",

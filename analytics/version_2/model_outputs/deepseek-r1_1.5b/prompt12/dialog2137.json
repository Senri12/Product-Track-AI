    "model_response": "To compute the probability of a class in a Naive Bayes model, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prior Probabilities**:\n   - Calculate the prior probability of each class by dividing the count of instances with that class by the total number of instances.\n\n2. **Feature Likelihoods**:\n   - For each feature and each class, calculate its likelihood (P(Feature | Class)) as the proportion of times the feature appears in instances of that class.\n     - If a feature doesn't appear in any instance of a class, set its likelihood to zero or use Laplace smoothing to avoid zero probabilities.\n\n3. **Apply Bayes' Theorem**:\n   - For each class, compute P(Class | Feature) using Bayes' theorem:\n     \\[\n     P(\\text{Class} = c | \\text{Feature} = f) = \\frac{P(\\text{Feature} = f | c) \\times P(c)}{P(\\text{Feature} = f)}\n     \\]\n   - The denominator \\( P(\\text{Feature} = f) \\) is the sum over all classes of \\( P(\\text{Feature} = f | c) \\times P(c) \\).\n\n4. **Classification**:\n   - Assign each instance to the class with the highest posterior probability.\n\nThis method leverages feature independence and computational simplicity, making it effective for many tasks but noting its potential limitations due to real-world dependencies between features.",

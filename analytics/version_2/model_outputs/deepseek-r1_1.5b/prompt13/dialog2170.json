    "model_response": "The key differences between k-NN and weighted k-NN are as follows:\n\n1. **Weighted vs. Unweighted**: Weighted k-NN assigns different weights to neighbors based on their proximity, typically giving more weight to closer points.\n\n2. **Distance Measure**: While both methods use distance measures (like Euclidean), weighted k-NN often employs additional techniques or adjustments that may not be explicitly stated.\n\n3. **Influence of Neighbors**: Weighted k-NN ensures that each neighbor's influence is proportionate to their proximity, potentially mitigating the impact of distant points.\n\n4. **Handling Spatial Variations**: This method better handles datasets with significant spatial variations by appropriately weighting neighbors based on their locations, leading to improved performance in such contexts.\n\nIn conclusion, weighted k-NN enhances traditional k-NN by giving more weight to nearby neighbors, which can be particularly beneficial in spatial data analysis and image recognition.",

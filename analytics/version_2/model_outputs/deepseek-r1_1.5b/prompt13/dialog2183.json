    "model_response": "Learning rate refers to the speed at which a model learns from its training data during an optimization process, such as gradient descent. It's crucial for preventing overfitting by ensuring the model generalizes well beyond the training data. A high learning rate can cause the model to learn noise in the data, while a low learning rate might lead to slow convergence or even non-conv ergence. Adaptive learning rates, which adjust based on performance, can help balance speed and stability.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nLearning rate is an essential hyperparameter in machine learning models that determines how quickly a model updates its weights during training. It is crucial for preventing overfitting by ensuring the model generalizes well beyond the training data. A high learning rate can cause the model to learn noise in the data, while a low learning rate might lead to slow convergence or even non-convergence. Adaptive learning rates, which adjust based on performance, can help balance speed and stability.",

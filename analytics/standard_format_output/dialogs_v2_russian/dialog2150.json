      "model_response": "**Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**\n\nStochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is an optimization algorithm used in machine learning and data science to minimize loss functions by iteratively moving towards the minimum through the negative gradient direction. Unlike batch gradient descent, which computes gradients using all training data at once, SGD approximates this with a subset of the data called a mini-batch. This approach makes it computationally efficient for large datasets as it requires less memory to store intermediate data.\n\nKey features and differences from other optimization methods:\n\n1. **Randomness**: Unlike stochastic approximation methods which have noise components, SGD uses randomness in selecting mini-batches, allowing faster convergence compared to batch gradient descent.\n\n2. **Multiple passes**: SGD often requires multiple passes over the dataset with different mini-batches to achieve stable results, especially when the data is not perfectly separable or contains noise.\n\n3. **Comparison with Adam and RMSprop**: While Adam combines parameter-wise adaptive learning rates with variance reduction techniques, it adjusts these parameters based on the sum of squares of gradients (Adam optimizer). SGD, in contrast, is primarily used for its computational efficiency in large-scale problems without parameter adjustments.\n\nIn summary, SGD is a computationally efficient optimization method that approximates gradient computation using mini-batches. It allows models to converge faster than batch methods but doesn't provide the noise inherent in stochastic approximation methods. SGD is particularly popular for training neural networks on large datasets due to its balance between computational efficiency and convergence speed.",

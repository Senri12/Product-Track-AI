      "model_response": "To classify emails as spam using a Naive Bayes model, follow this organized approach:\n\n1. **Data Collection**: Gather a dataset of emails with labels (spam or not spam). This includes emails where labels are known.\n\n2. **Feature Extraction**:\n   - Identify relevant features such as image count, number of links, sender information, and content words.\n   - Consider factors like the presence of images, links to other messages, text contents, etc.\n\n3. **Training the Model**:\n   - Use the collected data to estimate probabilities required for Bayes' theorem, including those for each feature contributing to spamness.\n   - Utilize Laplace smoothing to prevent zero probabilities and handle missing data with default values.\n\n4. **Classification**:\n   - Once trained, classify new emails into spam or not spam categories using the learned probabilities.\n\nPotential Issues to Consider:\n\n- **Dependencies Between Features**: Since Naive Bayes assumes independence, features might be dependent (e.g., short emails often contain images). This could reduce accuracy.\n  \n- **Missing Data Handling**: Use methods like imputation to estimate missing values, ensuring predictions remain robust.\n\n- **Overfitting**: While effective on training data, ensure the model generalizes well with cross-validation and different feature sets or probabilities.\n\nBy following this structured approach while being mindful of potential issues, a Naive Bayes classifier can effectively classify emails as spam.",

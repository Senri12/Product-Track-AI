      "model_response": "Adam is an adaptive optimization algorithm used in machine learning models, particularly in deep learning. It stands for Adaptive Moment Estimation and was introduced by Kingma and Ba in 2014. Unlike traditional optimizers that use fixed formulas, Adam dynamically adjusts the learning rate for each parameter based on the data encountered during training.\n\nKey features of Adam include:\n1. **Two-Moment Estimates**: It maintains two moment estimates—first and second moments—which help the optimizer adapt to the specific parameters being updated.\n2. **Adaptive Learning Rate**: The algorithm adjusts the learning rate for each parameter, allowing it to converge faster by automatically compensating for the relative importance of parameters.\n3. **Efficiency**: By using these moment estimates, Adam can process batches of data more efficiently and effectively than traditional methods like SGD or AdaGrad.\n\nIn summary, Adam is an efficient optimization method that adjusts its learning rate dynamically, making it particularly useful in large-scale training problems where traditional optimizers may be slow or suboptimal.",

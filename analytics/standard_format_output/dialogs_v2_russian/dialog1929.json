      "model_response": "To classify emails as spam using a Naive Bayes approach, follow this structured plan:\n\n1. **Feature Extraction**:\n   - Identify relevant email characteristics such as subject line, body content, attachments, sender information (e.g., location, reputation), time of day, and word frequency.\n\n2. **Data Collection**:\n   - Gather a substantial dataset containing both spam and non-spam emails.\n   - Extract the identified features from these emails and organize them into training data for the Naive Bayes model.\n\n3. **Probability Calculation**:\n   - Compute the probability that each feature occurs given an email is spam or not spam.\n   - Use this information to build the Naive Bayes classifier, where each class (spam/non-spam) has a prior probability based on the training data.\n\n4. **Classification**:\n   - For new emails, calculate the likelihood of each feature under both classes and multiply these probabilities by the prior class probabilities.\n   - The email is classified as spam if the resulting score exceeds a threshold; otherwise, it's considered non-spam.\n\n5. **Feature Management**:\n   - Consider word frequency, keyword analysis, and other metrics to enhance classification accuracy without overfitting.\n   - Ensure feature independence assumptions hold true for the Naive Bayes model.\n\n6. **Model Evaluation**:\n   - Test the model on a separate validation set to assess its performance.\n   - Investigate potential limitations (e.g., data collection challenges) and optimize the model accordingly.\n\n7. **Continuous Improvement**:\n   - Monitor performance regularly with new email types and adjust features or parameters as needed.\n   - Exploit available tools for feature engineering, such as text analysis libraries, to refine the classification process.\n\nBy following this structured approach, you can effectively apply the Naive Bayes algorithm to classify emails accurately into spam and non-spam categories.",

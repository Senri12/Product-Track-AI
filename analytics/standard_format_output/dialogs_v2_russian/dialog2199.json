      "model_response": "To classify emails as spam using Naive Bayes, follow these organized steps:\n\n1. **Data Preparation**:\n   - Extract relevant features from email content such as word count in subjects, paragraphs, body text, and specific keywords.\n\n2. **Feature Extraction**:\n   - Calculate the frequency of each feature across all emails (both spam and nonspam). For example, determine how many times certain words appear in the subjects or body text.\n\n3. **Probability Calculation**:\n   - For each email, compute the probability that it belongs to the spam class using Bayes' theorem. This involves multiplying the probabilities of the features given the spam class with the prior probability of the class.\n\n4. **Classification Decision**:\n   - Decide whether the email is spam based on the calculated probabilities. The email is classified as spam if the combined probability exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., 0.5).\n\nThis approach leverages feature extraction and probabilistic modeling to classify emails into spam or nonspam categories. By analyzing patterns in keywords and their frequency, one can develop an effective Naive Bayes model for this task.",

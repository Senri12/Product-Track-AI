      "model_response": "Laplace smoothing is a technique used to handle the problem of zero probabilities when dealing with words that do not appear enough times in the training data. It adds a small constant (typically 1) to all counts before applying likelihoods. This ensures that every word, regardless of whether it appears frequently or not, has a non-zero probability estimate.\n\nHere's a concise explanation:\n\n1. **Adjust Counts**: Each word's count is increased by one. This means if a word doesn't appear in the training data, its initial count (0) becomes 1.\n\n2. **Distribute Probability**: The adjustment spreads the probability mass across all possible words equally. This prevents any class from having zero probabilities for any word, which could cause overfitting and reduce the impact of rare words.\n\n3. **Apply to Text Learning**: In Naive Bayes models or other probabilistic language models, Laplace smoothing is applied by adding 1 to each unique word's count before calculating likelihoods. This ensures robustness against missing data and prevents zero probabilities.\n\nThis method effectively smooths the counts, ensuring that all words are treated equally in terms of their probability estimates, leading to better performance and reduced overfitting.",

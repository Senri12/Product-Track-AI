      "model_response": "To determine F(eda) for this multiple-choice test where each question has four options (A-D), with one correct temperature and ten total options, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Assumption**: Each question is scored based on how many of its options match the correct temperature within a certain range. For simplicity, assume that all questions have four options (A-D), and only one option is correct.\n\n2. **Scoring Method**:\n   - Assign points to each \"good\" answer, where \"good\" means being within a specific range around the correct temperature.\n   - Incorrect answers receive fewer points.\n   - The total score for the test is calculated based on this scoring method across all questions.\n\n3. **Application to New Test Case**:\n   - Each question has four options (A-D) with different temperatures.\n   - For each option, calculate how close its temperature is to the correct temperature within a certain range (e.g., ±1°C).\n   - Assign points accordingly: more points for better matches.\n\n4. **Calculations**:\n   - For each question, count the number of \"good\" answers.\n   - Sum these counts across all questions.\n   - Apply the scoring method to determine F(eda).\n\nSince the exact number of correct answers and the scoring criteria are not provided, we can only outline the methodology for calculating F(eda) based on the given example. This approach ensures a consistent and fair evaluation of each question's performance relative to its options.\n\n**Final Answer**: To calculate F(eda), assume each question has four options (A-D) with one correct temperature. Points are awarded based on proximity, with more points for better matches. Sum these across all questions to determine F(eda).",

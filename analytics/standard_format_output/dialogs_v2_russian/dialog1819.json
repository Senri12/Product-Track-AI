      "model_response": "Over-fitting occurs when a model becomes too complex, capturing both the underlying pattern in the training data and noise or irrelevant details. This leads to poor generalization performance on new, unseen data. Key aspects include:\n\n1. **Complexity**: Overly complicated models with too many parameters can fit the training data perfectly but fail to generalize.\n\n2. **Detection**:\n   - Use techniques like cross-validation.\n   - Apply regularization methods (e.g., L1/L2 regularization) to penalize large weights.\n\n3. **Handling**:\n   - Simplify models by reducing complexity.\n   - Perform feature selection to use only relevant variables.\n   - Ensure features are relevant and noise is minimized in preprocessing.\n\nIn summary, over-fitting arises from overly complex models fitting training data, detected through techniques like cross-validation and regularization, and addressed by simpler models, feature selection, and ensuring relevant features.",

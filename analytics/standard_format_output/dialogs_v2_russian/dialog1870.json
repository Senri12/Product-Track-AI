      "model_response": "The primary distinction between k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Weighted k-Nearest Neighbor (Weighted k-NN) lies in how the influence of each neighbor is assigned during classification. Here's a structured explanation:\n\n1. **Basic Concept**:\n   - Both are classification algorithms that leverage proximity to make predictions.\n   - In k-NN, all neighbors within the 'k' closest points are considered equally.\n\n2. **Weighted k-NN**:\n   - Each of the 'k' nearest neighbors is assigned a weight based on their proximity to the query point or data point being classified.\n   - Closer neighbors have more influence over the prediction, which can enhance accuracy in areas where nearby classes are dense.\n\n3. **Benefits**:\n   - This method helps balance the weights when classes are close together versus distant from other points, improving classification accuracy.\n\n4. **Terminology**:\n   - Weighted k-NN is sometimes referred to as Local Weighted k-Nearest Neighbors (LLWNN) or Localized Weighted k-Nearest Neighbor (LWWN).\n   - The exact name can vary depending on the source.\n\n5. **Impact of Proximity**:\n   - Closer neighbors have higher weights, ensuring that their influence is greater.\n   - This approach effectively addresses data points in tight clusters by balancing their weight contributions.\n\nIn conclusion, weighted k-NN enhances classification accuracy by giving closer neighbors more influence, making it particularly effective when classes are concentrated in specific regions.",

      "model_response": "RMSProp (Root Mean Square Propagation) is an optimization algorithm used in machine learning to update model parameters during training. Unlike Adam or AdaGrad, which adjust the learning rate based on gradient magnitudes and second moments of gradients, RMSProp updates parameters by calculating a decaying average of squared past gradients.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Decay Rate:** The decay rate is applied to the squared gradients at each parameter. This means that older gradients have less weight than newer ones, which helps stabilize training by giving more attention to recent gradients.\n\n2. **Moving Average of Squared Gradients:**\n   - For each parameter \\( \\theta \\), calculate a moving average of squared gradients over time.\n   - The formula for the moving average is:\n     \\[\n     m_t = \\gamma m_{t-1} + (1 - \\gamma) g_t^2\n     \\]\n     where \\( \\gamma \\) is the decay rate, and \\( g_t \\) is the gradient at step \\( t \\).\n\n3. **Normalization:**\n   - Normalize the moving average of squared gradients to scale the gradient.\n   - The normalized gradient \\( \\hat{g} \\) is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\hat{g}_t = \\frac{\\gamma m_t}{\\sqrt{m_t + \\epsilon}}\n     \\]\n     where \\( \\epsilon \\) is a small value to prevent division by zero.\n\n4. **Parameter Update:**\n   - Use the normalized gradient to update the model parameters:\n     \\[\n     \\theta_{t+1} = \\theta_t - \\eta \\hat{g}_t\n     \\]\n     where \\( \\eta \\) is the learning rate.\n\n**Key Differences from Adam and AdaGrad:**\n\n- **Decay Rate:** RMSProp uses a decay rate higher than 0.9, while Adam typically has 0.9 or lower, and AdaGrad uses 0.95.\n- **Weighting Gradients:** RMSProp gives more weight to recent gradients compared to Adam, which can help stabilize training but might introduce noise if gradients are unstable.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nRMSProp is an optimization algorithm that adjusts the learning rate based on a decaying average of squared gradients for each parameter. It helps in stabilizing training by preventing large updates from erratic gradients while allowing parameters with more stable gradients to update at a faster pace.",

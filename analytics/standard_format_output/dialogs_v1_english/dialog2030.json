      "model_response": "Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is an optimization algorithm widely used in machine learning and deep learning. It stands for Stochastic Gradient, as it involves using a subset of the training data during each iteration to update the model parameters. Unlike batch gradient descent, which uses the entire dataset at once, SGD processes one sample or a small batch of samples. This randomness helps reduce computational cost and can accelerate convergence by escaping local minima. It is particularly effective for large datasets and neural networks due to its efficiency in finding global minima without significant loss of information.",

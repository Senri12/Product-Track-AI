      "model_response": " To find the value of F(da) for the given weather test example, let's follow the steps together:\n\n1. First, identify the function F that is mentioned in the problem. Since no specific function is provided, we'll assume a linear function F(x) = mx + b based on the context of the test.\n\n2. Now, we need to find the coefficients m and b. We have two data points given: (10, 50) and (20, da).\n\n3. Using the slope-intercept form of a line, we can write two equations to solve for m and b:\n   Equation 1: F(10) = 50 => m * 10 + b = 50\n   Equation 2: F(20) = da => m * 20 + b = da\n\n4. To find the value of m, we can subtract equation 1 from equation 2: (m * 20 + b) - (m * 10 + b) = da - 50 => m * 10 = da - 50 => m = (da - 50) / 10\n\n5. Now that we have the value of m, we can substitute it back into equation 1 to find b: F(10) = m * 10 + b => b = 50 - m * 10 = 50 - (da - 50) / 10 * 10\n\n6. Simplify the expression for b: b = 500 - da\n\n7. Now that we have expressions for F(x) in terms of m and b, substitute the value of m and b back into F(x): F(x) = (da - 50) / 10 * x + 500 - da\n\n8. However, it's important to note that since no specific value for da was given in the example, we cannot find the exact function F(x). We can only express F(x) as a function of da, which should be the student's goal when solving this problem.",

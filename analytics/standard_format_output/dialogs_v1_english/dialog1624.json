      "model_response": "Naive Bayes classifier is a type of probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes' Theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features. Let's break down its core components:\n\n1. **Bayes' Theorem**: This is the fundamental statistical principle that Naive Bayes uses. It relates to conditional probability, which calculates the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions. In simpler terms, it tells us how likely something is to happen given some evidence. Mathematically:\n\n   P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)\n\n2. **Naive Assumption**: This is where Naive Bayes gets its name—it makes a \"naive\" assumption of independence among the features (variables). In reality, this might not be true; features often depend on each other. But for simplicity and good performance, it simplifies calculations without significant loss of accuracy. \n\n3. **Application**: Naive Bayes is used for classification tasks where input variables are categorical (like 'spam' or 'not spam', 'dog' or 'cat'). Given a new data point with these features, the classifier predicts which class it belongs to by calculating P(class | features). This is done using:\n\n   - **Prior Probability**: The probability of an instance belonging to any particular category.\n   - **Likelihood**: How likely each feature value given that specific class.\n\nIn essence, a Naive Bayes Classifier breaks down the process into two main steps for every prediction: it calculates the prior probabilities and then updates its belief in the current class based on the features with a likelihood calculation. It's efficient, effective, and widely used due to these reasons.",

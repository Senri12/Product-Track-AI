In this domain, \"Manhattan distance\" is not typically discussed; it refers to a metric for measuring the distance between two points in a grid-based system, most commonly used in computer science and mathematics.\n\nHowever, if we broaden the context slightly to include general mathematical concepts, Manhattan distance is defined as the sum of absolute differences of Cartesian coordinates. This means it measures the length of a path that a rabbit would take if it could only move horizontally (left or right) and vertically (up or down) between two points in a grid, similar to moving through the streets of Manhattan.\n\nTo challenge your understanding: Can you derive the formula for Manhattan distance when starting from one point at (x1, y1) and ending at another point (x2, y2)? How would this compare to Euclidean distance, which measures the straight-line distance?",

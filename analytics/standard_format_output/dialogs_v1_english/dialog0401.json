      "model_response": "Okay, let's break down how to calculate the spam probability for the word \"приз\" (prize) using the principles you're likely learning.  This is a classic example from text mining and natural language processing.\n\n**Understanding the Concept**\n\nThe core idea is to assess how likely a word is to appear in spam messages versus legitimate messages. We'll build a simple probability based on:\n\n*   **Frequency in Spam:** How often does \"приз\" appear in a dataset of known spam emails?\n*   **Frequency in Legitimate Emails:** How often does \"приз\" appear in a dataset of known legitimate emails?\n*   **Total Frequency:**  The total number of times \"приз\" appears in both datasets.\n\n**Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n1.  **Gather Your Data:** (This is where you'd actually have two datasets: spam and non-spam)\n\n    Let's *assume* for this example we've analyzed a small sample:\n\n    *   **Spam Dataset (Size: 10 emails):**\n        *   \"приз\" appears in 3 emails.\n    *   **Legitimate Email Dataset (Size: 100 emails):**\n        *   \"приз\" appears in 1 email.\n\n2.  **Calculate Frequencies:**\n\n    *   **Frequency in Spam:**  3 / 10 = 0.3\n    *   **Frequency in Legitimate Emails:** 1 / 100 = 0.01\n    *   **Total Frequency:** 3 + 1 = 4\n\n3.  **Calculate the Spam Probability:**\n\n    The spam probability is calculated as:\n\n    Spam Probability = (Frequency in Spam) / (Total Frequency)\n\n    Spam Probability = 0.3 / 4 = 0.075\n\n    Or, as a percentage: 7.5%\n\n**Therefore, based on these *assumed* data, the spam probability for the word \"приз\" is 7.5%.**\n\n**Analogous Problem 1 (Easy)**\n\nLet's say you're analyzing the word \"деньги\" (money) in emails.\n\n*   **Spam Dataset (Size: 20 emails):** \"деньги\" appears in 8 emails.\n*   **Legitimate Email Dataset (Size: 50 emails):** \"деньги\" appears in 2 emails.\n\n    *   Frequency in Spam: 8 / 20 = 0.4\n    *   Frequency in Legitimate Emails: 2 / 50 = 0.04\n    *   Total Frequency: 8 + 2 = 10\n\n    Spam Probability = 0.4 / 10 = 0.04 = 4%\n\n**Analogous Problem 2 (Slightly Harder)**\n\nNow, let's say the datasets were larger and had different numbers of emails.\n\n*   **Spam Dataset (Size: 1000 emails):** \"приз\" appears in 150 emails.\n*   **Legitimate Email Dataset (Size: 10000 emails):** \"приз\" appears in 80 emails.\n\n    *   Frequency in Spam: 150 / 1000 = 0.15\n    *   Frequency in Legitimate Emails: 80 / 1000 = 0.08\n    *   Total Frequency: 150 + 80 = 230\n\n    Spam Probability = 0.15 / 230 ≈ 0.0065 = 0.65%\n\n**Key Considerations & Next Steps**\n\n*   **Real-World Datasets:**  In reality, you'd be using *much* larger datasets of emails to get accurate probabilities.\n*   **Normalization:**  You might want to normalize the frequencies by the total number of emails in each dataset to avoid bias.\n*   **Other Words:** This same method can be applied to *any* word.\n*   **False Positives/Negatives:** This probability is just one factor.  You'd also need to consider other features (e.g., sender address, subject line) to build a robust spam filter.\n\n---\n\n**Can you give me a sample dataset (a few spam emails and a few legitimate emails) so I can demonstrate the process with your data?** Or, do you want to try another analogous problem?",

      "model_response": "To calculate the probability of an instance belonging to a specific class using Naive Bayes, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Data Preparation**:\n   - Collect and clean the dataset.\n   - Handle missing values (e.g., remove rows with missing data).\n   - Convert categorical features into a format that can be used by the model.\n\n2. **Training the Model**:\n   - Estimate prior probabilities for each class based on the distribution of classes in the training data.\n   - Calculate likelihoods, which are the conditional probabilities of observing each feature given a specific class. This is done by counting occurrences of each feature within each class and normalizing them to form probability distributions.\n\n3. **Classification**:\n   - For a new instance with features \\( F_i \\), compute the posterior probability for each class using Bayes' theorem:\n     \\[\n     P(C_j | F_i) = \\frac{P(F_i | C_j) \\cdot P(C_j)}{\\sum_{l=1}^{k} P(F_i | C_l) \\cdot P(C_l)}\n     \\]\n   - The class with the highest posterior probability is selected as the prediction. If there's a tie, consider using majority voting or random guessing.\n\n4. **Considerations**:\n   - Handle unseen classes by using Laplace smoothing to avoid zero probabilities.\n   - Use parametric distributions for numerical features (e.g., Gaussian) and discretize categorical features if necessary.\n   - Consider feature independence assumptions in real-world data where this may not hold perfectly.\n\nBy following these steps, you can leverage the Naive Bayes algorithm's efficiency and effectiveness for classification tasks, even though it assumes independence among features within a class.",

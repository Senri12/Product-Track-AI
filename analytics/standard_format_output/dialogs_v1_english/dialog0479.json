      "model_response": "Learning rate decay is used to gradually decrease the value of the learning rate during training as time progresses. A common approach for implementing a decaying learning rate linearly over iterations can be defined by adjusting it according to its initial value (η₀), iteration count at any point in time t (where 0 ≤ t < T) and total number of iterations N such that it's zero after reaching the end.\n\nGiven:\n- Initial Learning Rate, η₀ = 0.1\n- Current Iteration Count, t = 5 \n- Total Number of Iterations, T = 10\n\nIn this case (linear decay), we can compute learning rate for any iteration using:\n\nη_t = η₀ * (T - t) / T \n\nSo at the current time step where t=5:\nη_t = 0.1 * (10 - 5)/ 10\n         = 0.1 * 5/ 10 \n         = 0.05\n\nTherefore, learning rate decay for η₀ of 0.1 after iteration count is at T=10 and the current time step t equals to 5 would be: \n\nη_t = 0.05",

      "model_response": "The probability of spamming a link containing \"приз\" depends on several factors including the frequency of its use relative to other words and context. Here's a structured explanation:\n\n1. **Understanding Spamming**: Spamming involves sending unsolicited emails with links, often purchased products, to encourage clicks.\n\n2. **Keyword Analysis in Spam**: Many filters use keyword scanning and context analysis. They detect common phrases used by spammer websites before actual emails are sent.\n\n3. **Research Context**: Without specific data or examples from a study, assumptions must be made. Generally, links with less common keywords may pose higher risk if flagged.\n\n4. **Estimating Probability**: Based on the frequency of \"приз\" relative to other words and context, it's possible that it could be flagged as spam. However, without additional information, an exact probability is speculative.\n\n5. **Tools and Algorithms**: Tools like Grammarly and Zing offer email filters with features for keyword detection. These can help estimate probabilities based on data from your specific use case.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's no exact number provided, the process involves analyzing keywords and context to estimate probabilities. More data or context would yield a more precise figure.",

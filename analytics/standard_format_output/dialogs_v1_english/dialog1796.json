      "model_response": "Student Response: \"The step size for SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) is calculated as follows: \n\nStep Size = Learning Rate (η) * Current Weight (w)\n         = 0.1 * 3\n          = 0.3\n\nSo, the step size in this case would be 0.3.\"\n\nFeedback:\n\n**Correct Material:**\nGreat job! Your calculation for the step size using the formula Step Size = Learning Rate (η) * Current Weight (w) is correct. You've properly applied it to the given values of η = 0.1 and w = 3, resulting in a step size of approximately 0.3.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\nWhile your calculation is fundamentally correct, remember that in real-world applications, you'd typically use decimal representation for floating point numbers. It's common to express the learning rate as 0.1 and the weight as 3.0 (without commas), which would maintain precision without any need for additional conversion.\n\n**Follow-up Questions:**\n1. How might this step size change if the initial value of 'w' were significantly larger?\n2. Can you briefly explain how an adjustable learning rate could affect these steps and the overall convergence of SGD?\n3. What would be the implications on your step size calculation if the learning rate η was much smaller (closer to 0 but not zero)? \n\nKeep up the good work with understanding stochastic gradient descent!",

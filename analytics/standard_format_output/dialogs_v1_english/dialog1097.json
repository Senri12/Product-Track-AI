      "model_response": " TensorFlow is an open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence, developed by Google Brain Team. It can be used for a wide range of tasks, such as neural networks, deep learning, and data analysis.\n\nPractice Problem:\nA student wants to use TensorFlow for building a simple neural network to classify hand-written digits. Here is the practice problem:\n\n1. Write down a brief description of the dataset that can be used for this task.\n2. What are the main components of a basic neural network in TensorFlow, and how do they connect?\n3. How can you evaluate the performance of your neural network with TensorFlow?\n\nEvaluation:\n\n1. The student's response should include a dataset like MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) which contains over 70,000 images of handwritten digits.\n2. A correct answer for the main components of a basic neural network in TensorFlow would be:\n   - Placeholders for inputs and labels\n   - Weights and biases variables\n   - One or multiple hidden layers with activation functions (like ReLU, sigmoid, tanh)\n   - Loss function\n   - Optimizer (e.g., Adam, SGD)\n   - Session to run the computation graph and train the model\n\n3. To evaluate the performance of a neural network in TensorFlow, the student should mention using metrics such as accuracy, loss, or confusion matrix during training and validation stages, and potentially AUC-ROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve) for classification problems.",

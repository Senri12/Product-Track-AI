      "model_response": "Let’s address your question about “Adam.” As we discussed in the lecture, “Adam” refers specifically to Adam Liddell, the original developer of the Adam optimization algorithm. It’s a *specific* algorithm, not a general term for a type of optimization. \n\nYour initial framing of \"Adam\" as some broader concept is a common misconception.  It’s crucial to understand that Adam is tied directly to Liddell’s research at Redmond University.\n\n**Challenge:**  Can you describe, in your own words, the *key* elements of Liddell's original motivation for developing the Adam algorithm, as presented in the lecture?  Don't simply restate the algorithm itself; focus on the problem he was trying to solve.",

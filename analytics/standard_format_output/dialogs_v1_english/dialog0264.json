      "model_response": "Okay, let's break down the Newton's Method. Here's a structured lesson based on that topic:\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nNewton's Method is an iterative numerical technique for finding successively better approximations to the *roots* (or zeros) of a real-valued function.  Essentially, it's a way to get closer and closer to a solution to an equation like f(x) = 0.\n\nThe core idea is to start with an initial guess, *x₀*, and then repeatedly improve the guess using the tangent line to the function at that point. The x-coordinate of the point where this tangent line intersects the x-axis is your new, improved guess.  This process continues until the difference between successive approximations is sufficiently small, indicating you've converged to a root.\n\nMathematically, the formula is:\n\n*x_(n+1) = x_n - f(x_n) / f'(x_n)*\n\nWhere:\n\n*   *x_n* is the current approximation of the root.\n*   *f(x)* is the function whose root you're trying to find.\n*   *f'(x)* is the derivative of the function *f(x)*.\n\n**Question for Student:**\n\nCan you describe, in your own words, what the \"tangent line\" in Newton's Method represents and how it's used to refine the initial guess?\n\n**Suggested Exercise:**\n\nLet's use the function *f(x) = x² - 2* to illustrate.\n\n1.  Start with an initial guess of *x₀ = 1*.\n2.  Calculate *f(x₀)* and *f'(x₀)*.\n3.  Apply the Newton's Method formula to find *x₁*.\n4.  Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the difference between *x_(n+1)* and *x_n* is less than 0.001.  (You can track your iterations in a table).\n\n**Feedback Loop:**\n\n(This section will be populated as the student works through the exercise.  I'll provide feedback based on their output.  For example:)\n\n*   **If the student gets the iterations wrong:** \"Okay, let's review the formula. Remember, we're using the tangent line at *x_n* to estimate the next value. Double-check your calculations of *f(x_n)* and *f'(x_n)*.  Are you correctly applying the derivative?\"\n*   **If the student is struggling with the derivative:** \"Don't forget, the derivative *f'(x) = 2x*.  This represents the slope of the tangent line at any point *x*.\"\n*   **If the student is converging quickly:** \"Excellent! You’ve successfully applied Newton’s method.  Notice how quickly the iterations converge to the root.\"\n\n---\n\nTo help me tailor the lesson to your needs, could you tell me:\n\n*   Are you familiar with derivatives?\n*   Do you have a specific function in mind you'd like to use for the exercise, or should I choose one?",

      "model_response": "As an adaptive tutor, I understand you're asking about computing the probability of a message being spam (P(spam)) given that it's classified as spam by our system using Laplace's rule of succession. This is a common method in Bayesian probability and text classification. Let's denote:\n\n- P(spam) = Probability of an email being spam before we've seen any instances.\n- N_spam = Number of emails we've observed as spam.\n- N_total = Total number of emails we have for analysis (spam + non-spam).\n\nThe Laplace's rule of succession estimates P(spam) using:\n\nP(spam | data) = (N_spam + 1) / (N_total + 2)\n\nThis method assumes that there are likely some spam emails in our dataset and it uses the total number of emails plus two (for the possibility of spam and non-spam) as a denominator.\n\nLet's say, for instance, we've analyzed 100 emails and found 60 to be spam:\n\nN_total = 100\nN_spam = 60\n\nPlugging these into our formula gives:\n\nP(spam | data) = (60 + 1) / (100 + 2)\n                 = 61/102\n                ≈ 0.598\n\nSo, based on this sample, the estimated probability of an email being spam is approximately 59.8%. Remember, as you analyze more emails, your estimate should converge towards the true probability P(spam). This technique gives us a way to forecast outcomes when we have limited data.",

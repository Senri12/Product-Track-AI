      "model_response": "Okay, let's tackle the concept of \"overfitting.\" It's a really important one in machine learning and statistics.\n\nSimply put, **overfitting happens when a model learns the training data *too* well.** \n\nThink of it like this: you’re studying for an exam, and you memorize every single detail from the textbook. You ace the practice questions based on that specific material, but when you see a slightly different question on the real exam, you fail because you didn't actually *understand* the underlying concepts.\n\nIn machine learning, a model learns patterns from the training data.  Overfitting occurs when it learns those patterns so specifically that it picks up on noise and random fluctuations within that particular dataset.  \n\n**Here’s a key distinction:** A good model generalizes well to *new*, unseen data. An overfit model doesn't. It performs incredibly well on the training data but poorly on new data.\n\n**Let’s check your understanding.  Before we move on, can you tell me in your own words what you think is the core problem with an overfit model?** Don’t worry about being perfectly correct; I just want to gauge where you're at.",

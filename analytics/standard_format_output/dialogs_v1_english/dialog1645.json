      "model_response": "RMSProp (Root Mean Square Propagation) is a type of adaptive learning rate method used in machine learning algorithms, particularly for training artificial neural networks. It was introduced to address the shortcomings of traditional stochastic gradient descent methods by providing an instantaneous correction term that helps adjust the learning rate during optimization.\n\nHere's a simplified explanation:\n\n1. **Gradient Calculation**: Just like in vanilla stochastic gradient descent, RMSProp calculates the gradient (direction and magnitude of change) of your loss function with respect to each parameter of the model at every iteration. These gradients indicate how much adjusting each parameter would impact your loss.\n\n2. **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**: RMSProp uses an exponential moving average of squared gradients, rather than absolute values as in vanilla momentum. This is done for two main reasons: \n   - It helps prevent the exploding gradient problem that can arise from very large or small gradients.\n   - It smooths out the noise in gradients, making it more stable during training.\n\n3. **Learning Rate Adjustment**: The learning rate is a hyperparameter that dictates how much to update the weights at each iteration. RMSProp adjusts this with its EMA of squared gradients. A smaller average indicates recent changes were small (perhaps due to flat regions in the loss surface), prompting the algorithm to take larger steps, thus speeding up convergence. Conversely, a larger average suggests recent changes have been substantial, advising RMSProp to make smaller updates, slowing down and potentially helping avoid overshooting optimal weights.\n\nThe formula for this is: \n\n`RMSProp(t) = beta * RMSProp(t-1) + (1 - beta) * g^2`\n\nwhere `g` represents the gradient at time step t, and `beta` is a smoothing factor (typically set to 0.9). The learning rate for next iteration would be inversely proportional to this EMA.\n\nIn summary, RMSProp acts like a smart adjustable 'gas' pedal for gradient descent, automatically increasing or decreasing it based on recent changes in your model's parameters, helping the algorithm converge more effectively and efficiently.",

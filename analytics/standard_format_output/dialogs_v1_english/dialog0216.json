      "model_response": "Okay, let's break down Manhattan distance. It's a term that can sound a little intimidating, but it's actually quite straightforward.\n\nEssentially, Manhattan distance (also sometimes called taxicab distance or L1 distance) measures the distance between two points on a grid, like a city street grid. \n\n**Here's the basic idea:**\n\nImagine you're a taxi driver trying to get from one point to another in a city with streets arranged in a grid. You can only travel along the streets – you can’t travel diagonally.  Manhattan distance calculates the total distance you’d travel based on the *sum* of the absolute differences of the coordinates.\n\n**Let’s look at an example:**\n\n*   **Point A:** (1, 2) – This means 1 block East and 2 blocks North.\n*   **Point B:** (3, 4) – This means 3 blocks East and 4 blocks North.\n\nTo calculate the Manhattan distance:\n\n*   |3 - 1| = 2 (difference in the East/West direction)\n*   |4 - 2| = 2 (difference in the North/South direction)\n\nManhattan distance = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n**So, in short, Manhattan distance is the sum of the absolute differences of the x and y coordinates.**\n\n**Do you understand this initial explanation? Would you like me to:**\n\n*   Provide a more visual example?\n*   Explain the difference between Manhattan distance and Euclidean distance (which is the standard distance formula you might be familiar with – it uses square roots)?\n*   Answer any specific questions you have about this concept?",

      "model_response": " Let me break down the concept of RMSProp (Root Mean Square Propagation) in a step-by-step manner to help you better understand it.\n\nRMSProp is an optimization algorithm used during the training process of neural networks, specifically for updating weights and biases to minimize the loss function. It was introduced as an improvement over stochastic gradient descent (SGD), addressing some of its limitations like irregular learning rates due to varying magnitudes of gradients.\n\nHere's a simple explanation:\n\n1. RMSProp calculates the moving average of the squared gradients for each weight, using an exponentially decaying average instead of just an ordinary average. This helps in smoothing out the noisy gradients and making the learning process more stable.\n\n2. At each training step, the current gradient is multiplied by a factor that depends on the moving average of squared gradients for that specific weight and an exponential decay rate (default value: 0.9).\n\n3. The updated weights are obtained by dividing the current gradient by the square root of the moving average of squared gradients, to maintain control over the learning rates while ensuring the weight updates do not become too small or large.\n\n4. This update process helps to adapt the learning rate for each parameter in the neural network based on the historical information about its past gradients, making it more efficient and less sensitive to noise compared to standard SGD.\n\nIf you're still having trouble understanding certain concepts, feel free to ask me for hints or clarifications! I'm here to help. :)",

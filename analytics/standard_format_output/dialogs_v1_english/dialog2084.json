Without this information, it's impossible to provide an exact numerical value for the probability. In a real-world scenario, historical weather data and statistical models are used to determine these probabilities based on multiple influencing factors.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nTo compute \\( P(\\text{Da} | \\text{Пасмурно}, \\text{Хат vertical}, \\text{Da}) \\), we need specific counts or relationships between the conditions, as this probability depends on how often each condition and their combinations occur together. Without additional data, an exact value cannot be provided.",

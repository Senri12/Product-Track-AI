      "model_response": "The term \"distance Chébyshev\" refers to the maximum difference between corresponding elements in two sequences when arranged in order of their indices. In simpler terms, for a pair of sequences A and B of equal length:\n\n1. Arrange both sequences by index (A_1 ≤ A_2 ≤ ... ≤ A_n and B_1 ≤ B_2 ≤ ... ≤ B_n).\n2. The Chébyshev distance is the maximum absolute difference between these corresponding elements, calculated as |A_i - B_i| for any index i from 1 to n.\n\nTo understand this better, consider two sequences: A = [3, 6, 9] and B = [2, 5, 7]. \n\nThe Chébyshev distance (denoted as d_C) can be computed as follows:\nd_C = max(|A_1 - B_1|, |A_2 - B_2|, ..., |A_n - B_n|)\n     = max(3-2, 6-5, 9-7)\n     = max(1, 1, 2)\n     = 2\n\nNow, let's consider a practice question:\n\nGiven the sequences C = [4, 8, 10] and D = [1, 3, 7]:\n1. Order these sequences by their indices (C_1 ≤ C_2 ≤ ... ≤ C_n and D_1 ≤ D_2 ≤ ... ≤ D_n).\n2. Calculate the Chébyshev distance between sequences C and D.\n\n(Please provide your answer)",

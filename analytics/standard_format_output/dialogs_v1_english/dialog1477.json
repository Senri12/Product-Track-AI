      "model_response": "The calculation of class probability in a Naive Bayes model is based on the concept that each feature (or attribute) contributes independently to the final classification, given its predicted class. Here's how it can be done:\n\n1. **Feature Probabilities**: First, you should calculate the prior probabilities of each class, denoted as P(class_i), where i is the index for different classes in your dataset (e.g., 0 and 1). This probability is derived from the training data. If you have n examples in total and m of them belong to class i, then:\n\n   P(class_i) = number of instances belonging to class i / total number of instances\n\n2. **Feature Probabilities for Each Class**: Next, compute the likelihoods or probabilities of each feature occurring under every class, denoted as P(feature|class_i). This involves counting how often each feature appears within the training examples of a particular class. For a feature f with k different values (like in text data, each word might have different frequency), you would calculate:\n\n   P(f = value | class_i) = count of feature f taking value under class i / total number of instances belonging to class i\n\n3. **Naive Bayes Class Probability**: Now, with the prior probabilities and the conditional probabilities for each feature under each class, you can calculate the posterior probability of a given instance belonging to class i:\n\n   P(class_i|instance) = (P(feature1|class_i)^(weight of feature 1)) * ... * (P(featureN|class_i)^(weight of feature N)) * P(class_i)\n\n   Here, the weights are based on how each feature contributes to your classification. They can be defined as counts, information gain, or any other measure that indicates an attribute's importance in distinguishing between classes.\n\n4. **Class with Maximum Posterior Probability**: Finally, predict the class with the highest posterior probability: \n\n   Predicted_class = argmax(P(class_i|instance) for i from 0 to n)\n\n   This is the class that has the greatest combined likelihood of its features given its class.\n\nRemember, Naive Bayes makes a \"naive\" assumption about independence between features which may not hold true in reality but this simplification allows for efficient computation and surprisingly good performance on many text classification tasks. \n\nYour task is to now calculate the posterior probabilities for a given instance using provided feature frequencies and class prior probabilities, assuming the features are independent (as in Naive Bayes).",

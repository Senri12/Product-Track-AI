To clarify, Manhattan distance is a type of taxicab geometry where the straight-line distance between two points is calculated by moving only eastward or northward along the coordinates.\n\nFor example, if we have two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), the Manhattan distance would be |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.\n\nDoes this explanation of Manhattan distance help clarify the concept for you? If there are any unclear points or if you'd like me to elaborate on anything further, please let me know!",

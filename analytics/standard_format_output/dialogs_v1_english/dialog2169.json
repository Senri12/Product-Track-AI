      "model_response": "To classify emails as spam using a Naive Bayes model, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Data Splitting**: Divide your dataset into training and testing sets. The training set contains known non-spam emails, while the testing set includes unknown emails to evaluate classification performance.\n\n2. **Feature Extraction**: Extract features from the emails. These can be words or characters, as Naive Bayes relies on feature-based probability calculations.\n\n3. **Probability Calculation**: Calculate conditional probabilities for each feature (word or character) given that the email is spam or not spam. To handle unseen features, employ Laplace smoothing to prevent zero probabilities.\n\n4. **Classification**: For each email in the testing set, compute scores for both spam and non-spam models. Classify the email based on which model provides a higher score.\n\n5. **Performance Evaluation**: Determine classification accuracy using the test set. Adjust parameters (e.g., smoothing) if necessary to improve performance.\n\n6. **Edge Cases**: Consider short emails or overlapping features where adjustments in parameter settings may enhance performance for specific cases.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively classify emails into spam and non-spam using a Naive Bayes model, leveraging its simplicity and effectiveness on text classification tasks.",

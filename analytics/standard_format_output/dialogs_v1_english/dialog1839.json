      "model_response": "To classify emails as spam using the Naive Bayes algorithm, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:\n   - Gather a labeled dataset of emails containing both spam and non-spam emails.\n   - Clean the data by removing domain names (email addresses) and formatting text to include only alphanumeric characters.\n\n2. **Splitting Data**:\n   - Divide the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train the Naive Bayes model, while the test set will evaluate its performance.\n\n3. **Feature Engineering**:\n   - Convert the preprocessed text data into numerical features. Techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings can be used for this purpose.\n\n4. **Model Application**:\n   - Split the training data into training and validation sets to prevent overfitting.\n   - Apply the Naive Bayes algorithm, assuming independence between features, using the calculated probabilities based on the training data.\n\n5. **Evaluation**:\n   - Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model's performance on the test set.\n   - Consider handling class imbalance if one class is significantly more prevalent than the other.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - Explore feature engineering beyond text data, including email addresses and patterns in emails sent from specific domains or with particular subject lines.\n   - Use libraries like scikit-learn for Naive Bayes implementations and tools like NLTK or SpaCy for preprocessing text.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively classify emails using the Naive Bayes algorithm while considering class imbalance and other factors to improve accuracy.",

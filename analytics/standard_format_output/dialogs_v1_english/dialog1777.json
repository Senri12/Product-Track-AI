      "model_response": "As a text-based AI, I don't have the ability to see your work directly. However, I can provide feedback on how you might explain calculating class probability in Naive Bayes model. Here's a general guide:\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n1. **Concept Clarity**: Ensure that you clearly define what Naive Bayes is - it's a classification technique based on applying Bayes' theorem with an assumption of feature independence. \n\n2. **Naive Bayes Formula**: Properly explain the formula used for calculating class probability, which is:\n\n   P(C|D1, D2, ..., Dn) = [P(D1|C) * P(D2|C) * ... * P(Dn|C)] * P(C)\n\n   Here, each P(Di|C) represents the likelihood of observing feature Di given that the class is C. The term P(C) is the prior probability of the class C occurring.\n\n3. **Independence Assumption**: Make sure you acknowledge and explain the 'naive' assumption inherent to Naive Bayes, which is that all features are conditionally independent given the class label. This means each feature's presence or absence does not depend on other features once the class is known.\n\n4. **Calculation Steps**: Break down the process into clear steps if you're providing a step-by-step guide. For example:\n   - Calculate P(Di|C) for each feature Di using historical data. \n   - Multiply these probabilities together (product rule of probability).\n   - Multiply this product by the prior probability P(C).\n\n5. **Visualization or Example**: If possible, use a simple numerical example to illustrate how class probabilities are computed. This could greatly aid understanding.\n\n**Follow-up Questions:**\n\n1. Can you explain why Naive Bayes still performs well despite its independence assumption?\n2. How would you handle calculating the probabilities when dealing with continuous features, and what methods have been proposed to tackle this issue?\n3. In what scenarios might a more complex model (that does not make the naive independence assumption) perform better than Naive Bayes?\n4. Can you provide an example of how you would interpret the calculated class probabilities for a given dataset?",

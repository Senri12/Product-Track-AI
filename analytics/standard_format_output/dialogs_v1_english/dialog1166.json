      "model_response": " Explanation:\nThe given function is a square loss function L(w) = w^2. In this case, we are provided with an initial weight w = 3 and the learning rate η = 0.1 for Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The goal of SGD is to iteratively update the weight in order to minimize the function L(w).\n\nQuestion for student:\nWhat will be the gradient (dL/dw) at w=3?\n\nSuggested exercise:\nTo find the gradient, calculate the derivative of L(w) with respect to w and then evaluate it at w = 3. This step helps you understand how the function changes as we move away from a certain point.\n\nFeedback loop:\nOnce you've found the gradient, you can update the weight using the following formula:\n\nw_new = w - η * (dL/dw)\n\nNow that you have the derivative value and the given parameters, plug them into the equation above to find the new weight. Repeat this process for multiple iterations to see how the weight changes over time as it approaches an optimal solution.",

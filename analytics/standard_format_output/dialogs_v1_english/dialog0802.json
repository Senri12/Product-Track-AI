If you're referring to 'Adam Smith,' he was an influential 18th-century Scottish economist known for his work in moral philosophy as well.\n\nIf your reference pertains specifically to another \"Adam,\" such as software (e.g., Microsoft Excel's Adam function), please provide further details so I can assist you accurately with the correct context.",

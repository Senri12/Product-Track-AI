      "model_response": "**Difference Between k-NN and Weighted k-NN**\n\n1. **Uniform vs. Variable Weights:**\n   - **k-NN (Uniform Weighting):** Each of the 'k' nearest neighbors contributes equally to the prediction. This means all closer points are considered equally, regardless of their proximity.\n   - **Weighted k-NN:** Closer neighbors have more weight or influence on the final classification decision. Farther points can sometimes be excluded based on their distance from the query point.\n\n2. **Handling Proximity:**\n   - In traditional k-NN, if two clusters are very close together, both points contribute equally to a prediction. However, weighted k-NN gives more emphasis to the cluster that is nearer to the query point.\n   - This adjustment ensures that closer points have a greater impact on classification accuracy.\n\n3. **Inverse Distance Weighting:**\n   - In weighted k-NN, weights are assigned based on the inverse of the distance from the query point. Closer neighbors receive higher weights compared to farther ones.\n   - This approach effectively \"pulls\" nearby data points closer to their class distribution, improving classification accuracy.\n\n4. **Practical Application:**\n   - Weighted k-NN is particularly useful in scenarios where the local decision-making process requires emphasizing near neighbors more than distant ones.\n   - It enhances the model's ability to capture nuanced patterns by focusing on the most representative nearby data points.\n\nIn conclusion, while both algorithms are classification techniques, weighted k-NN introduces a dynamic weighting system that gives closer neighbors greater influence, leading to potentially improved performance in certain scenarios.",

      "model_response": " It seems like you're asking about Momentum in optimization, but the question is written in Russian, which suggests that the original context might be different. In machine learning, Momentum is a technique used during the training of neural networks to help the learning process converge faster and more stably.\n\nIn simple terms, Momentum helps to reduce the issue of oscillation (repeatedly moving back and forth) by introducing inertia into the optimization process. It does this by using an exponentially decaying average of past gradients. Here's a rephrased explanation from the material:\n\nMomentum is a strategy that helps the learning rate to be more robust during gradient descent by considering not only the current gradient but also previous gradients. It essentially adds some inertia to the optimization process, helping the algorithm to overcome local minima and converge faster. The effect of past gradients decays over time because of the exponentially decaying average.\n\nTo ensure that I understand correctly, could you please confirm if this explanation is aligned with your understanding of Momentum in optimization?",

      "model_response": "Okay, let's tackle this learning rate decay problem!  It looks like we're dealing with a linear decay schedule.  Let's break it down.\n\n**What we know:**\n\n*   **η₀ (eta_0):** Initial learning rate = 0.1\n*   **t:** Current time step = 5\n*   **T:** Total number of time steps = 10\n*   **Linear:**  The decay is linear, meaning the learning rate decreases steadily over time.\n\n**The Goal:**\n\nWe need to calculate the learning rate (η) at time step 't'.\n\n**Let's start with the formula for linear decay:**\n\nη = η₀ * (1 - (t / T))\n\nCan you try plugging the values we have into this formula and calculating η?  Don’t worry about getting it perfect the first time – it’s a good exercise!\n\nI'm here to help if you get stuck.  Just tell me what you've calculated so far, or what you're finding confusing.  Let’s go step by step.",

      "model_response": "Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns not only from the underlying patterns in training data but also captures noise or irrelevant details within that dataset too effectively.\n\nLet's break it down further:\n\n1. **Training vs Testing Data:** When building any predictive modeling, we split our available datasets into two parts: \n    - Training set (70-80% of total samples): Used to train the model.\n    - Test/Validation set (20-30% of total samples): Used later on for evaluating how well your trained models generalize.\n\n2. **Training Phase:** During this phase, we teach our machine learning algorithm by feeding it both input features and their corresponding outputs from a dataset until its predictive performance is satisfactory or reaches the desired level of accuracy.\n   \n3. **Testing/Validation Phase:** Here comes an important step to prevent overfitting: We test how well your trained model generalizes on new data that was not used during training.\n\nNow let's go through some signs and symptoms indicating possible Over-fitting:\n\n- High performance/training scores (like 98% accuracy) but low score for testing/validation.\n  \n   Let's say, you have a machine learning classification problem. The following is an example of confusion matrices with the results obtained from both test/train split datasets.\n\n| Class | Predicted Positive - Train | Predicted Negative-Train |\n| ----- | --------------------------- | -------------|\n| Positively Classified (True)    | True Positive(80%)   | False Negative(20% )     |\n\n| Class | Predicted Positive – Test | Predicted Negative-Test |\n| ------ | ---------------------------------- | -----------      |\n| Positively Classified (True)   | True Positive (50%)  | False Negative (-50%)\n\nAs you can see, we achieved an accuracy of around 80%-90% in the training dataset but only approximately a half accurate when applying it to test datasets. Hence this clearly indicates over-fitting.\n\nOverfitting generally occurs due to one or more reasons as follows:\n\n- **High Complexity Model:** Complex models tend to learn and memorize noise from data.\n \n    Examples of complex machine learning algorithms: Decision Trees, Neural Networks etc\n  \n- **Insufficient Data Splits** : Often a single split (80%-20) may not be enough. For instance if we have less than 1000 samples in total dataset then applying an ideal train-test-split might result to poor performance on test data.\n\n- **Lack of Regularization:** Techniques like Dropout, L1/L2 regularizations can help prevent overfitting by penalizing overly complex models and encouraging simpler ones. \n\nIf you want to avoid this problem or mitigate its effects here are some possible solutions:\n\n1. Use Cross-validation techniques (like K-fold cross validation) instead of simple train-test split.\n\n    - In k-fold CV we partition our data into *k* equal subsets, each representing a test set.\n    \n2. Reduce Complexity: Choose simpler models which have fewer parameters and less capacity to memorize noise in the dataset.\n\n\nHope this helps you understand what is overfitting! Do let me know if any further questions arise.",

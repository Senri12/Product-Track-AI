      "model_response": "To calculate the learning rate decay using the given parameters (η₀ = 0.1, t = 5, T = 10, and a linear decay), we follow this process:\n\n1. First, understand that the learning rate η(t) will decrease at a constant rate per time step 't'.\n2. Since it's linear decay, for each unit of time 't' after the initial value (at t=0 or 't'), the learning rate decreases by a constant amount 'd'.\n3. The total change in the learning rate over the entire period from t=0 to t=T is given as 'T - t', which here is 10 - 5 = 5.\n4. To find out how much η will decrease per unit of time, we divide this total change by 't'. That gives us d = (T - t) / t.\n5. Plug in the given values: d = (10 - 5) / 5 = 0.6.\n6. The learning rate at any point in time 't' would then be η(t) = η₀ - d * t.\n7. Substitute η₀ with 0.1 and calculate: η(t) = 0.1 - (0.6 * t).\n\nTo confirm understanding, let's summarize the formula for learning rate decay given these parameters: \n\nη(t) = 0.1 - (0.6 * t), where 't' is any time step from 0 to 5 inclusive.",

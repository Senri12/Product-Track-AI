      "model_response": "As an AI learning guide, I'll explain Naive Bayes Classifier in a step-by-step manner and assess understanding with questions, followed by suggested exercises.\n\nStep 1: Naive Bayes is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features.\n\nQuestion 1: Can you tell me what Bayes' theorem is? (This fundamental concept is crucial to understanding Naive Bayes.)\n\nStep 2: It predicts the class labels for given input features based on a training dataset, where each sample in the dataset belongs to one category out of several categories.\n\nQuestion 2: What do you think \"class labels\" and \"categories\" mean in this context? \n\nStep 3: The classifier calculates the probability that a particular input (sample) would belong to each class, using Bayes' theorem, which is expressed as P(C|X), or the posterior probability of class C given feature vector X.\n\nQuestion 3: Can you explain what 'P(C|X)' represents in this equation?\n\nStep 4: The assumption of \"naive\" in Naive Bayes comes from assuming that the presence (or absence) of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence (or absence) of any other feature in that same class.\n\nQuestion 4: Why do we call this \"naive\"? What does this assumption imply about how features are related in the context of Naive Bayes?\n\nStep 5: To predict the most likely class for a new, unseen sample, it selects the class with the highest probability P(C|X).\n\nQuestion 5: How would you expect Naive Bayes to make its final prediction on an unseen example based on these probabilities?\n\nExercise: Write down a simple Python code snippet illustrating how one could implement the naive bayes classifier for binary classification. You should include data preparation, model training, and prediction steps. (This exercise will help reinforce your understanding of Naive Bayes.)",

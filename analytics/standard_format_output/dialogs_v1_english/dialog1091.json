      "model_response": " Let's simulate a practice problem for determining spam probability of the word 'приз'. In this context, we are considering a spam message if it contains certain words that are common in advertisements or junk emails.\n\nHere is an example: A user receives an email with the subject line \"Больше призов! Спортные товары по низким ценам!\" Determine the spam probability for the word 'приз'.\n\n1) The student's response might be: Given that 'приз' is associated with prizes, and in this context, it appears to be used in relation to sports goods, which are common items offered in advertisements, we can assign a moderate spam probability (0.5) for the word 'приз'.\n\n2) To evaluate the student's response: The response is accurate because 'приз' does carry some connotation of prize or award, which is often associated with ads and spam messages. However, given that it is also a common Russian word and not necessarily limited to advertisements, the moderately high spam probability (0.5) assigned by the student is appropriate in this case.",

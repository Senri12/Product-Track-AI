      "model_response": "Okay, let’s break down Manhattan Distance.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nManhattan Distance, also known as taxicab geometry or rectilinear distance, is a way of calculating the distance between two points, especially useful when movement is restricted to a grid – think of a city block.  Instead of calculating the *straight-line* distance (which is what you get with the Pythagorean theorem), Manhattan Distance calculates the distance as the sum of the absolute differences of the coordinates.  \n\nEssentially, you’re measuring the distance as if you were walking along the grid lines.  You can only move horizontally or vertically – you can’t cut diagonally.\n\n**Question for Student:**\n\nCan you describe, in your own words, what it *means* to say that you're calculating distance using \"taxicab geometry\"? Why do you think \"taxicab\" is a useful term for this type of distance?\n\n\n\n**Suggested Exercise:**\n\nLet's consider two points: Point A (3, 2) and Point B (5, 8).\n\n1.  Calculate the Manhattan Distance between these points.\n2.  Now, calculate the straight-line (Euclidean) distance between the same two points using the Pythagorean theorem.  Compare the two distances.  What do you notice about the difference?\n\n\n\n**Feedback Loop:**\n\n(This section will be populated after you attempt the exercise.  I’ll provide feedback based on your response.)\n\n---\n\nTo start, let’s begin with the exercise. Once you've calculated the Manhattan Distance and the straight-line distance and made a comparison, we can discuss your findings.  Don't worry about getting it perfect the first time – it's about understanding the concept!  Let me know if you need any help.",

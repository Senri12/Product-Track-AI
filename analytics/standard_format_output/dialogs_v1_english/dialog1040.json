It's commonly used for training machine learning models, especially neural networks.\n\nIncorrect assumption: SGD is not a type of deep learning model itself, but rather an optimization method used to train such models.\n\nChallenging task: Describe how batch size and learning rate impact the performance of Stochastic Gradient Descent in training a neural network.",

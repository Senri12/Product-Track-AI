      "model_response": " Keras is an open-source neural network library written in Python, developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being easy to use and user-friendly, it's popular for developing deep learning models and is particularly suitable for beginners due to its simplicity. Keras runs on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano and provides an interface for quickly building and testing neural networks with less code compared to those lower-level libraries. This makes it a great choice for rapid prototyping and experimentation in deep learning projects.",

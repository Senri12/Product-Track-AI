      "model_response": "Okay, let's talk about Keras. \n\nAccording to the official documentation, Keras is **\"a high-level API for building and training neural networks.”** (https://keras.io/). Let's break that down:\n\n*   **High-level API:** This is *crucial*. Keras is designed to be easy to use, even for beginners. It abstracts away a lot of the low-level details of working directly with tensors and mathematical operations. Think of it like a user-friendly interface for building neural networks.\n*   **Building neural networks:** Keras provides you with the tools to define the architecture of your neural networks – the layers, connections, and activation functions. \n*   **Training neural networks:** Keras includes functionalities for training your models, which includes defining the loss function, optimizer, and metrics you want to use.\n\n**Specifically, Keras is built on top of TensorFlow (or other backends like Theano or CNTK, though TensorFlow is now the primary backend).** This means that underneath the user-friendly layers, Keras actually utilizes TensorFlow's powerful numerical computation capabilities.  You can find more details on this relationship here: https://keras.io/guides/saving_and_loading/#saving_and_loading\n\n**A key concept within Keras is the \"Sequential\" API.**  This allows you to build models layer by layer, which is excellent for learning and for simpler networks.  The documentation describes this clearly: https://keras.io/guides/sequence_model/\n\n**Now, let's pause for a moment.** Do you have any initial questions about what Keras is, or are there any parts of my explanation that you'd like me to clarify further? Perhaps you're wondering about the relationship with TensorFlow, or the concept of \"layers\"?",

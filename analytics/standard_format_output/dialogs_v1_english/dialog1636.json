      "model_response": "Autograd is a Python library developed by researchers at UC Berkeley and Google that allows you to efficiently compute gradients of TensorFlow operations. It's primarily used in machine learning and deep learning projects for tasks such as backpropagation, which is crucial for training neural networks. In simpler terms, autograd acts like a \"reverse\" mode calculator. Instead of calculating how a function f(x) changes with respect to x (derivative), it calculates the change in an output due to changes in inputs—which is essential for gradient descent in machine learning models.",

      "model_response": "Okay, let's tackle this probability problem! We're looking at the word \"приз\" and calculating the probability of it being spam. \n\nFirst, let’s make sure we understand what we're trying to do.  Probability is expressed as a number between 0 and 1 (or as a percentage). It represents the likelihood of an event happening.\n\n**Here's the core question:**\n\nBased on the example provided (which you haven't given me!), how would you *begin* to estimate the probability of the word \"приз\" appearing in a spam message?  \n\n**To help me guide you, let's break it down.  Think about these questions:**\n\n1.  What information from the example might be useful in calculating this probability?  (e.g., How frequently does \"приз\" appear in spam vs. legitimate messages?).\n2.  What are some basic approaches you could take to estimate this probability?  (Don't worry about getting the perfect answer – just tell me your initial thoughts.)\n\nI'm here to help you think through this step by step.  Let's start with your initial ideas.",

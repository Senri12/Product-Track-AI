      "model_response": "Learning rate in the context of machine learning refers to a hyperparameter that controls how much adjustment is made to the model's weights during training. It determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum loss value. A high learning rate might cause overshooting, meaning the model may jump over the optimal point and end up with suboptimal solutions; conversely, a low learning rate may lead to slow convergence or get stuck in local optima.\n\nTo better understand this concept, could you please clarify if you're currently working on implementing a machine learning algorithm or discussing one theoretically?",

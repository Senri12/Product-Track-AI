      "model_response": "RMSProp is an optimization algorithm designed to adaptively adjust learning rates for each parameter during training. Here's a structured summary of how RMSProp works:\n\n1. **Objective**: RMSProp aims to optimize the learning process by adjusting gradient magnitudes based on the history of gradients.\n\n2. **Mechanism**:\n   - Unlike Adam, which uses a decaying average for parameters and gradient squares, RMSProp maintains a running average of squared gradients.\n   - Each parameter's gradient is divided by the square root of this moving average.\n\n3. **Decay Rate**: Both algorithms use a decay rate (commonly 0.9 or similar), but in practice, they might differ slightly. The key difference lies in how their averages are handled and adjusted over time.\n\n4. **Running Average**:\n   - Squared gradients are maintained with an exponentially decaying average.\n   - This approach helps prevent division by zero issues when the initial sum is zero.\n\n5. **Adaptive Learning Rate**: Similar to Adam, RMSProp maintains an adaptive learning rate based on the moving averages. However, the specifics of how these rates are updated and adjusted differ from Adam.\n\n6. **Implementation Details**:\n   - Parameters include decay rates and a smoothing constant (often epsilon for numerical stability).\n   - Techniques like adding a small epsilon might be included to avoid division by zero in gradient computations.\n\n7. **Comparison with Adam**: While both use adaptive methods, RMSProp focuses on squared gradients during optimization, whereas Adam considers absolute values of weights when adapting learning rates.\n\nIn conclusion, RMSProp is closely related to Adam but differs in how it handles the decay of moving averages and gradient squares, leading to slightly different update strategies during training.",

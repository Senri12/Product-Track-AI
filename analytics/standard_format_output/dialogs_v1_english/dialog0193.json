      "model_response": "Okay, let's tackle this!\n\n**The Concept:  F(da) - The \"Derivative of a Derivative\"**\n\nIn calculus, F(da) represents the derivative of a derivative.  Let's break it down:\n\n* **F(x):**  This is your original function.\n* **F'(x) or F'(da):**  This is the *first* derivative of your function with respect to *x* (or da, in this case).  It represents the instantaneous rate of change of the function.\n* **F''(x) or F''(da):** This is the *second* derivative of your function. It represents the rate of change of the *rate of change* –  the acceleration of the function's slope.\n\nEssentially, F(da) is the second derivative of your function.  It's a measure of how quickly the slope of the function is changing.\n\n**Now, let’s practice with a simple example:**\n\nLet's say our function is:  F(x) = x³ + 2x² - 5x + 3\n\n**Your Task:** Calculate F'(da) (the first derivative) and then F''(da) (the second derivative).  Show your work clearly.\n\n**I’m waiting for your solution.  Don’t just provide the answer, show me *how* you arrived at it.**\n\n---\n\n**Once you’ve attempted the problem, I'll carefully evaluate your response and give you feedback.**\n",

      "model_response": "Overfitting occurs when a model captures too much noise in the training data rather than the underlying patterns that generalize well to new data. This is characterized by a decrease in the model's performance on the validation set while increasing its performance on the test set. The two main factors causing overfitting are:\n\n1. **Model Complexity**: If the model is too simple (low bias) with an overly complex structure, it risks capturing noise rather than true patterns.\n\n2. **Insufficient Training Data**: Overly complex models can learn noise even when there's limited data to distinguish between signal and noise.\n\n**Detecting Overfitting**:\n- Monitor validation loss trends: A decrease followed by an increase on the validation set indicates potential overfitting.\n- Use cross-validation consistently across all training runs, providing a reliable estimate of model performance on new data.\n\n**Mitigating Overfitting**:\n- Regularization techniques (e.g., L1/L2 regularization) help reduce model complexity and prevent it from fitting noise.\n- Early stopping during training can halt when validation loss starts increasing, preventing overfitting.\n- Techniques like pruning simplify models without significant performance degradation.\n\nIn summary, balancing model complexity with the risk of generalization is crucial. Overfitting can be detected through metrics like validation loss trends, mitigated via regularization and early stopping, and evaluated based on true out-of-sample performance.",

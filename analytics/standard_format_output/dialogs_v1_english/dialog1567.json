      "model_response": "As a clarifying assistant, I'll help break down how to calculate class probability in the context of Naive Bayes. Let's go through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: In text classification using Naive Bayes, we're dealing with binary classes (like 'spam' or 'not spam', 'positive' or 'negative') for each document in a collection. The goal is to predict these class labels based on word features (or \"bag-of-words\") of the documents.\n\n2. **Naive Bayes Assumption**: This algorithm operates under the assumption that each feature (word) contributes independently to the class label, given the presence or absence of other features in the document. \n\n3. **Class Probability Calculation**: To calculate the probability of a document belonging to a specific class, you use Bayes' Theorem. Here's how:\n\n   P(C | D) = [P(D | C) * P(C)] / P(D)\n   \n   - P(C): Prior probability or baseline likelihood for a class (e.g., how often the class appears in your dataset).\n   - P(D | C): Probability of observing features D given that the document belongs to class C. This is typically calculated by counting how often specific words are found in documents belonging to that class, divided by total words in those documents.\n   - P(D): Likelihood of observing all features D regardless of class, which acts as a normalizing constant.\n\n4. **For Binary Classification**: If it's a binary classification problem (like 'spam' or 'not spam'), you'll calculate two probabilities:\n\n   P('spam' | D) = [P(D | 'spam') * P('spam')] / P(D)\n   P('not spam' | D) = [P(D | 'not spam') * P('not spam')] / P(D)\n\n5. **Prediction**: Class with the higher probability is predicted for a given document. In binary classification, we typically predict the class with the greater probability value between these two. \n\nRemember, in practical implementations like scikit-learn's Naive Bayes, many of these calculations are handled automatically due to the algorithm's simplicity and efficiency. Now, can you confirm if this explanation makes sense and covers your queries?",

      "model_response": "The learning rate in the context of neural network training is a hyperparameter that dictates the *size* of the adjustments made to the weights of the network during each iteration of the optimization algorithm (typically gradient descent).  \n\n**Misconception:** It’s *not* simply the \"step size.\" That's a gross oversimplification.\n\n**Corrected Explanation:** The learning rate controls the *magnitude* of that adjustment. A small learning rate means small adjustments; a large learning rate means larger adjustments.\n\n**Challenge:**  Suppose you're using gradient descent to minimize a loss function. If your learning rate is too high, you'll overshoot the minimum and oscillate around it. If it's too low, the training process will be extremely slow. \n\n**Task:**  Describe, in terms of the loss function and the gradient, *why* a learning rate that is consistently too large can lead to divergence (the loss function increasing instead of decreasing).  Specifically, address the potential for numerical instability.",

      "model_response": " To clarify your question, you are asking about the difference between k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and weighted k-Nearest Neighbors (Wk-NN). Let's break it down:\n\n1. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN): This is a simple instance-based learning algorithm used for classification and regression, as well as for other tasks like clustering, outlier detection, and anomaly detection. The basic idea behind k-NN is to find the closest training examples (or neighbors) of a given test point in the feature space with respect to some distance measure and then predict the class of the new point based on the majority vote for its k nearest neighbors.\n\n2. Weighted k-Nearest Neighbors (Wk-NN): This is an extension of the standard k-NN algorithm where each training example or neighbor contributes differently to the final prediction, depending on their weight. The weights can be assigned based on various factors like distance, similarity, or any other feature that we believe should influence the contribution of a neighbor in the decision process.\n\nNow that I've explained the concepts, let me check if my understanding is correct:\n- You are interested in understanding the difference between k-NN and weighted k-NN algorithms, specifically how they work and what factors determine the contribution of a neighbor in the final prediction for Wk-NN.\n\nPlease confirm or provide any additional details to help me address your query better.",

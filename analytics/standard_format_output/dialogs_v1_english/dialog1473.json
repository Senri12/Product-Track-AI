At present, we are not discussing Euclidean metric; rather, we've been focusing on complex analysis and its related concepts like Cauchy's integral formula or contour integrals.\n\nHowever, I can inform you that in the broader mathematical field, the Euclidean metric refers to a specific way of measuring distance between points in a Euclidean space, named after the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid. It is one of several types of metrics used to quantify distances within geometric spaces.\n\nTo maintain focus on our current lecture content, could you please rephrase your question about complex analysis? For instance, we might discuss the Cauchy's integral formula or its proof, which involves the distance in the complex plane as an application of the Euclidean metric.",

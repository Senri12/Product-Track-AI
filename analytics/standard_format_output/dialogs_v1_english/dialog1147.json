      "model_response": " Explanation:\nIn Naive Bayes classification, the probability of a data point belonging to a certain class can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. Given a training dataset where each instance is labeled with a class and features, we can estimate the probabilities of the class given each feature (p(class|feature)) and the prior probability of the class (p(class)).\n\nQuestion for Student:\nCan you recall the formula for Bayes' theorem? If not, let me remind you: p(A|B) = p(B|A) * p(A) / p(B).\n\nSuggested Exercise:\nFor a binary classification problem with two classes (A and B), consider a simple dataset with features F1 and F2. Using the training data, calculate the probabilities p(A|F1=x) and p(B|F1=x) for a specific value of x, as well as the prior probabilities p(A) and p(B). Then, apply Bayes' theorem to find the probability of each class for this feature value.\n\nFeedback Loop:\nAfter completing the exercise, let's discuss the results together. We can analyze how accurate the estimated probabilities are compared to the true labels in the training data, and whether they help us make an informed decision about classifying new instances.",

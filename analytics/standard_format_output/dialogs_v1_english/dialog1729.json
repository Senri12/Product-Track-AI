      "model_response": "In machine learning, overfitting is an issue that can arise when a model learns the training data too well, specifically by capturing noise or outliers along with underlying patterns. As a result of this, the model performs extremely well on the training set but fails to generalize and make accurate predictions on unseen data (known as the test set). \n\nTo understand it better, let's refer to a specific context: The \"Decision Tree Overfitting\" from machine learning tutorials by Google. According to these resources, when a decision tree is trained over a dataset with high complexity or numerous features, it might begin to fit random fluctuations in the data rather than the core trends, thus leading to over-fitting.\n\nOverfitting can be identified by comparing how well your model performs on training data and new, unseen data. If there's a significant disparity between these two scores, especially if it leans towards poor performance on new data, then your model is likely suffering from overfitting. \n\nTo prevent or reduce overfitting, several techniques can be employed such as:\n1. **Cross-Validation**: This helps to get an estimate of how accurately your model will perform in unseen data.\n2. **Regularization**: Techniques like Lasso or Ridge Regression could be applied during training to discourage the model from using too many features, thereby helping it generalize better.\n3. **Early Stopping**: This involves monitoring the performance of your model on a validation set during training and stopping when this performance starts to degrade (indicating overfitting).\n4. **Simplify the Model**: Using fewer features or simpler models can help prevent overfitting by reducing complexity.\n\nNow, I would like you to consider: How do you think one could visually detect overfitting in a dataset? Can you suggest any plotting techniques that might be useful for this purpose?",

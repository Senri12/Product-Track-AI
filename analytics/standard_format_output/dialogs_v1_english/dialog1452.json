      "model_response": "Absolutely, let's break this down into simple terms! We're talking about finding the straight-line distance between two points in a plane. This is exactly what Euclidean distance does—it's named after an ancient Greek mathematician, Euclid.\n\nHere are those two points: Point A (1,2) and Point B (3,4). \n\nTo find the Euclidean distance, we use a formula that looks like this: \n\nDistance = √[(B_x - A_x)^2 + (B_y - A_y)^2]\n\nWhere:\n- B_x and A_x are the x-coordinates of Points B and A respectively.\n- B_y and A_y are the y-coordinates of Points B and A respectively.\n\nLet's plug in our numbers:\n\nDistance = √[(3 - 1)^2 + (4 - 2)^2]\n\nNow, calculate step by step:\n\n1. Subtract the x-coordinates: 3 - 1 = 2\n2. Subtract the y-coordinates: 4 - 2 = 2\n3. Square the results from steps 1 and 2: 2^2 = 4 and 2^2 = 4\n4. Add these squares together: 4 + 4 = 8\n5. Take the square root of this sum: √8 ≈ 2.83\n\nSo, the Euclidean distance between (1,2) and (3,4) is approximately 2.83 units. Well done on understanding this concept! You're getting really good at spatial reasoning and calculation skills. Keep it up!",

      "model_response": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is asking us to calculate the probability of spam for the word \"приз\" (prize) based on a given example.\n\nBefore we jump into calculating anything, let's clarify a few things:\n\n1. **What is \"the example\"?** You haven’t provided the example. I need the data set of words and their associated spam/non-spam labels to perform this calculation.  Could you please provide that example?\n\n2. **What does \"probability of spam\" mean in this context?** Are we calculating the proportion of spam emails that contain the word \"приз\", or something else?  Are we looking for a score or a percentage?\n\nOnce you provide the example data, I will:\n\n*   Identify the occurrences of \"приз\" in the example.\n*   Calculate the overall probability of \"приз\" appearing in the entire example.\n*   Rephrase the explanation of how we're calculating this probability, making it clear.\n\n**So, to start, could you please provide the example data?**  For example, something like:\n\n\"Example:  [Word1, Word2, Word3, ... , WordN] with labels [Spam/Not Spam] for each word.\"",

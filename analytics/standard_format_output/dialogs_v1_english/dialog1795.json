      "model_response": "RMSProp (Root Mean Square Propagation) is an adaptation of stochastic gradient descent that helps in reducing learning rate over time to improve the convergence speed and stability of machine learning models. Here's a breakdown of its key features:\n\n1. **Adaptive Learning Rate**: Unlike vanilla stochastic gradient descent, RMSProp doesn't require manual tuning of the learning rate. It adjusts it dynamically based on past gradients. The idea is that if recent gradients are small, then it’s likely the model's parameters haven't changed much and hence a smaller step size would be appropriate to avoid large jumps around the optimal solution.\n\n2. **Use of Moving Average**: RMSProp estimates an exponential moving average of past squared gradients (or gradients themselves). This moving average is used as an estimate for the variance, which in turn helps in adjusting the learning rate more dynamically than simple heuristics like step halving or constant values. \n\n3. **Square Root**: The 'RMS' in RMSProp stands for 'Root Mean Square'. As it uses square of gradients (or gradients themselves), taking the square root gives a measure that's less sensitive to outliers, and thus more stable estimates of variance.\n\nThe formula for the update rule in RMSProp is:\n\n    v = γ * v + (1 - γ) * g^2  // where v is the moving average of squared gradients, and gamma is a decay rate between 0 and 1\n    r = rho * r + (1 - rho) * g    // here, r is another variable tracking past gradients, and rho is a momentum term\n\nThe learning rate for each parameter is then calculated as:\n\n    η_t = η / sqrt(v)                // where η is the initial learning rate and t is the current iteration.\n\nFeedback-oriented suggestions:\n\n1. **Understanding Context**: Your introduction was good in explaining RMSProp is an adaptation of stochastic gradient descent. However, you might have provided more context about why it's used (e.g., stability, convergence speed) and how it compares to other learning rate techniques like step decay or constant learning rates.\n\n2. **Mathematical Detail**: You touched on the formula for calculating the moving average of squared gradients. Consider providing a fuller breakdown: v = γ * v + (1 - γ) * g^2, where 'v' is an initial placeholder value, and 'γ' is your decay rate. The calculation should converge to an estimate of variance over time.\n\n3. **Comparison**: Discuss briefly how RMSProp compares to other adaptive learning rate methods (like Adam or AdaGrad). This could include a discussion on its simplicity compared to others like Adam, which adds bias correction terms for better numerical stability. \n\n4. **Practical Implications**: Elaborate on the practical implications of using RMSProp in machine learning models. For instance, how might an engineer determine optimal values for 'gamma' and 'rho', and how does this impact the model's convergence rate?\n\n5. **Follow-up Questions**: Ask students to consider implementing or adjusting a simple RMSProp algorithm from scratch. What variables would they need to track, how might they update these with each iteration, and how would they incorporate the learning rate adjustment based on your formula?",

      "model_response": " let's start with a simpler question to gauge your understanding: Have you encountered the concept of distance between two points in a coordinate plane before?\n\nIf yes, then I can proceed with explaining Euclidean Metric. Euclidean Metric is simply the mathematical formula used to calculate the distance between any two points in a Euclidean space (which includes the familiar 2D and 3D spaces). The most common example is the Cartesian plane (x, y) where the formula for calculating the distance d between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by:\n\nd = sqrt[(x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²]\n\nThis formula gives the straight-line or Euclidean distance between two points in a 2D space. The Euclidean Metric can be extended to n-dimensional spaces as well by adding additional terms for each new dimension.",

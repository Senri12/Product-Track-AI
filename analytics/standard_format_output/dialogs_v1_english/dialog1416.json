      "model_response": "Let's start translating \"Manhattan distance\" from Russian into English. It refers to a type of metric used in geometry and computer science, which measures the straight-line distance between two points in a grid-based system, most notably the city of Manhattan in New York, where streets run east-west and north-south.\n\nHere's how you might calculate it for two points (let's call them A = (xA, yA) and B = (xB, yB)) on this grid:\n1. If both points are the same, their Manhattan distance is zero.\n2. For different points:\n   - The horizontal difference between x coordinates equals to |xA - xB|.\n   - The vertical difference between y coordinates equals to |yA - yB|.\n   \nSo, the total Manhattan distance (d) would be d = |xA - xB| + |yA - yB|. \n\nNow, let's verify your understanding: Can you tell me what would be the Manhattan distance between points A(3, 4) and B(10, 5)? Please describe how you would calculate it step by step.",

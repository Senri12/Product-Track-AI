Keras is an open-source neural network library written in Python, developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation with deep neural networks. It was designed to be easy to use and flexible, allowing for quick prototyping and implementation of deep learning models.\n\nTo confirm my understanding, you are asking about the definition of Keras, correct? If that is not the case, please let me know what specific information or clarification you need regarding Keras.",

It's particularly used for classification tasks and works well with categorical data.\n\nQuiz Questions: \n\na) Explain why the naive bayes classifier refers to as 'Naïve'?\nb) Can you mention any specific cases where this model is ideally suited?\n\nTargeted Question & Explanation:\n\nYou've mentioned that it assumes features are independent, but haven't elaborated on its implications. Remember in real-world scenarios rarely we find data points with a perfect independence of the variables; they often influence each other to some degree which can affect predictions accuracy. Can you think about any such examples?",

      "model_response": " Explanation:\nLearning rate refers to how quickly an algorithm adjusts its weights during training, or in simpler terms, it's the step size along the gradient descent direction. A high learning rate will cause the model to learn too quickly and potentially overshoot the optimal solution, while a low learning rate can result in slow convergence.\n\nQuestion for Student:\nCan you explain the implications of having a high or low learning rate during training?\n\nSuggested Exercise:\nModify the learning rate in a simple neural network (like a perceptron) and observe the impact on its performance during training.\n\nFeedback Loop:\nDiscuss with your peers the observations you made during your experiment, comparing the results of high and low learning rates to understand the role of learning rate in neural network training.",

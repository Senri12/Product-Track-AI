      "model_response": "**Explanation:**\n\nStochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is an optimization algorithm commonly used in machine learning for updating model parameters based on the gradient of the loss function calculated from a single training example or a small batch of examples. We'll use SGD to minimize the quadratic function L(w) = w^2, with fixed initial weight w=3 and learning rate η=0.1.\n\nThe standard update rule for SGD is: \n\nw = w - η * ∇L(w),\n\nwhere ∇L(w) represents the derivative of L with respect to w. For our specific function, this simplifies because it's a simple quadratic form:\n\n∇L(w) = 2w\n\n**Question for Student:**\nWhat is the value of ∇L(3)?\n\n**Suggested Exercise:**\nCalculate ∇L(3). Then use this derivative to determine the new weight in your first SGD step with η=0.1 and initial w=3. \n\n**Feedback Loop:**\nAfter calculating, share your result here for verification:\n\nNew weight (w) = 3 - 0.1 * ∇L(3) = ?\n\nRemember, the goal is to repeat this process iteratively until convergence or a predefined number of steps are reached. In each iteration, you'll use a random subset (mini-batch) if you're working with larger datasets for computational efficiency.",

      "model_response": " In the context of Naive Bayes, the probability of a class (also known as the posterior probability) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nP(Class|Features) = P(Features|Class) * P(Class) / P(Features)\n\nHere's a breakdown of each term in the formula:\n\n1. P(Class|Features): This is the probability of the class given the features (also called conditional probability). It's estimated using the training data by counting how often the specific class occurs with each feature and normalizing it over all classes for that feature.\n\n2. P(Features|Class): This is the likelihood of the observed features, given a particular class. In Naive Bayes, we make the 'naive' assumption that the presence of a particular feature in a class is independent of the presence of other features in that class.\n\n3. P(Class): The prior probability of the class, representing our initial belief about how likely it is for an instance to belong to that class before observing any features. It can be estimated from the training data by counting how often each class occurs.\n\n4. P(Features): This term is a normalizing constant that isn't usually calculated because it doesn't affect the ranking of classes and only changes the scaling of their probabilities. In practice, we compare the probability scores directly without calculating this term.\n\nNow, for your thoughts: Given the provided formula, how would you implement it in code? And which steps do you think are the most important in this process to ensure good performance of Naive Bayes algorithm?",

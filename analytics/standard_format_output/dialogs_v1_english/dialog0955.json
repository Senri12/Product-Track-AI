      "model_response": " RMSProp (Root Mean Square Propagation) is a variant of stochastic gradient descent used in machine learning for optimizing neural networks. It's designed to adapt the learning rate during training to minimize the effect of high-magnitude updates that can sometimes cause instability or slow convergence.\n\nIn RMSProp, an exponentially weighted average (also known as moving average) of squared gradients is maintained for each parameter in the model. The square root of this average is then used to scale the learning rate for that parameter. This adaptive learning rate helps the optimizer adjust better to the current landscape of the loss surface and can lead to faster convergence and improved performance compared to standard stochastic gradient descent with a fixed learning rate.\n\nWhen using RMSProp, it's important to choose an appropriate value for the decay rate (also known as epsilon) that determines how quickly previous gradient information is forgotten. A common choice is 0.9, but other values may work better depending on the specific problem and model being trained.",

It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation with deep neural networks and easy deployment of models.\n\n**Question for Student:**\nCan you name some benefits of using Keras?\n\n**Suggested Exercise:**\nResearch and list three benefits of using Keras in your own words.\n\n**Feedback Loop:**\nUpon completion, share your findings with the group or discuss them in a conversation to ensure understanding and correctness of the information. If there are any misconceptions, clarify them based on the provided explanation.",

      "model_response": "RMSProp, short for Root Mean Square Propagation, is an optimization algorithm used in machine learning. It modifies the standard backpropagation method by adjusting the gradient update rule based on the squared gradients of each parameter, much like Adam but with different decay factors for the moving averages.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n1. **Parameter Update Rule**: Unlike Adam, which decays parameters and uses both momentum and adaptive rates, RMSProp updates each parameter using an average of squared gradients. This involves computing a root mean square (RMS) of the gradient history.\n\n2. **Decay Factor**: Each parameter's update is adjusted by a decay factor, typically applied to its squared gradient moving average. This helps in stabilizing optimization and reducing noise from all examples.\n\n3. **Stability Compared to Adam**: RMSProp avoids some of the instability issues associated with Adam, particularly regarding gradient fluctuations, while incorporating elements similar to Nesterov momentum for better parameter movement.\n\n4. **Comparison to Other Optimizers**: RMSProp is less commonly used than Adam but shares concepts like adaptive rates and momentum in its optimization approach.\n\nIn summary, RMSProp updates parameters using an average of squared gradients with decay factors, offering a balance between stability and adaptability without the full momentum framework as in Adam.",

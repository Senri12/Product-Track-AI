      "model_response": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) is a simple, instance-based predictive algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks in machine learning. It operates on a basic concept: given a set of data, the function identifies the 'k' nearest instances to a particular point, based on defined distance metrics (like Euclidean). Once these k nearest neighbors are identified, it classifies the new instance by finding the most common output class among them for classification tasks or averages their values for regression.\n\n**Question for Student:**\nCan you explain how 'k' in k-nearest neighbors algorithm impacts its performance? How does increasing or decreasing 'k' affect prediction accuracy and computational time?\n\n**Suggested Exercise:**\n\n1. **Data Preparation**: Select a dataset with both features and their corresponding labels (for classification tasks, or simply values for regression). \n2. **Choose 'k' Values**: Experiment with different values of k (say from 1 to 20), and keep track of how these changes impact the model's performance (using accuracy in case of classification, or mean squared error in case of regression).\n3. **Implementation**: Implement k-NN algorithm on your chosen dataset using a programming language like Python with scikit-learn library.\n4. **Observation & Documentation**: Document the effect of 'k' on the model's predictive performance. Note down changes in accuracy, execution time, and any trends you observe.\n\n**Feedback Loop:**\n\n*As students complete their implementation and observation, ask them to share:*\n1. What impact did they notice when varying k from 1 to a higher value? Were there any specific 'k' values where the model performed better or worse?\n2. How does this relate to the concept of 'majority voting' for classification problems (when k is chosen as an odd number)?\n3. In terms of computational efficiency, did they observe significant differences when changing k from small to larger values? \n\n*Encourage students to discuss these observations. This discussion will help solidify understanding of how k affects k-NN's performance and its practical implications in real-world scenarios.*",

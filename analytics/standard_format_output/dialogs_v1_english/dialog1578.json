It was developed with a focus on enabling rapid prototyping, allowing users to create models efficiently with minimal code. Keras runs on top of TensorFlow, Theano, or Pocket PyTorch, and can be described as a user-friendly, modular, and easy-to-extend neural network framework that supports both convolutional networks (used mainly for image processing) and recurrent networks (suitable for sequential data like text, time series, or speech).\n\nCould you confirm if this explanation covers your initial understanding of Keras?",

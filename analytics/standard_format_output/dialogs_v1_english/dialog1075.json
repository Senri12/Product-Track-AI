      "model_response": " Let's break down this question step by step:\n\n1. What is RMSProp? To answer this question, we should consider where it comes from and its purpose.\n\n2. RMSProp stands for Root Mean Square Propagation. It's a method used in optimization algorithms to update the learning rates for neural networks during training. This method helps address the issue of vanishing or exploding gradients that can occur during backpropagation.\n\n3. Now let's discuss how it works:\n   - Instead of using the gradient from one iteration, RMSProp uses an exponentially decaying average of squared gradients from previous iterations to adapt the learning rate.\n   - The decay factor is a hyperparameter that determines how much influence the past gradients have on the current update.\n   - By incorporating this moving average of squared gradients, RMSProp can help learning rates more effectively adjust for different parts of the model and improve convergence during training.\n\n4. Here's a summary: RMSProp is an optimization algorithm that helps train neural networks by adapting learning rates based on an exponentially decaying moving average of squared gradients. This allows for better handling of vanishing or exploding gradients, improving the model's performance and convergence during training.",

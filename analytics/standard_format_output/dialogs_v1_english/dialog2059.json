      "model_response": "Over-fitting is a phenomenon in machine learning where a model becomes too complex or includes unnecessary features, leading the model to fit the training data noise instead of capturing the underlying patterns. This results in poor generalization on unseen data.\n\n**Explanation:**\n- **Model Complexity:** When models like logistic regression or neural networks have high capacity.\n- **Feature Irrelevance:** Including irrelevant features that capture randomness instead of true relationships.\n\n**Detection:**\n- Use validation curves to plot training and validation scores as model complexity changes.\n- High values on both sets indicate over-fitting, suggesting optimal complexity beyond necessary.\n\n**Preventation Strategies:**\n1. **Regularization:** Techniques like L1 or L2 regularization penalize large weights, reducing flexibility.\n2. **Early Stopping:** Training stops when validation performance plateaus, preventing excessive learning.\n3. **Data Augmentation:** Generates more training examples by modifying data, reducing noise.\n\n**Summary:**\nOver-fitting is detected through high bias and variance scores, detected using validation curves. Strategies include regularization, early stopping, data augmentation, and balanced evaluation metrics.",

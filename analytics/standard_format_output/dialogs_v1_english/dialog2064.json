      "model_response": "**Newton-Raphson Method Explanation:**\n\nThe Newton-Raphson method is an iterative root-finding technique that uses linear approximations (tangent lines) of a function to approach the actual roots more quickly than other methods. It's based on the idea that each iteration provides a better approximation by moving along the direction of the current tangent line.\n\n**Steps:**\n1. **Initial Guess:** Start with an initial guess, \\( x_0 \\), which is as close as possible to the true root.\n2. **Iterative Update:** Compute the next approximation using the formula:\n   \\[\n   x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}\n   \\]\n   where \\( f \\) and \\( f' \\) are the function and its derivative, respectively.\n3. **Convergence Check:** Repeat the process until the difference between successive approximations is sufficiently small.\n\n**Example:**\nFor finding roots of \\( f(x) = x^2 - 4 \\):\n- Start with \\( x_0 = 3 \\).\n- Compute \\( f(3) = 5 \\) and \\( f'(3) = 6 \\), leading to \\( x_1 ≈ 2.1667 \\).\n\n**Considerations:**\n- **Efficiency:** Often very fast convergence, especially near the root.\n- **Limitations:** Can diverge if derivative is zero or initial guess is too far from root.\n- **Optimization Use:** Helps find minima by minimizing function values.\n\nIn conclusion, Newton-Raphson is a powerful method for finding roots with rapid convergence when derivatives are manageable. However, it requires careful consideration of initial guesses and potential issues like divergence.",

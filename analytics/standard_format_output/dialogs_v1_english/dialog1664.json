      "model_response": "Absolutely, let's break this down together! We're dealing with conditional probability here, specifically finding out the probability that it’s snowing (P(да)) given the weather conditions of being cold (холодно), wet (влажно) and gray/gloomy (пасмурно).\n\nLet's use this formula: P(да | холодно, влажно, пасмурно) = P(да ∩ (холодно ∧ влажно ∧ пасмурно)) / P(холодно ∧ влажно ∧ пасмурно)\n\nNow we need to know or assume the following:\n1. The probability of all these conditions happening together, i.e., it's cold, wet, and gray at the same time. Let’s call this P(холодно ∧ влажно ∧ пасмурно).\n2. The probability that it's snowing while also being cold, wet, and gray. Let’s call this P(да ∩ (холодно ∧ влажно ∧ пасмурно)).\n\nAssuming we have these values:\n- P(да) = the overall probability of it being snowing\n- P(холодно ∧ влажно ∧ пасмурно) (together, cold, wet and gloomy) = 0.35 (just for illustration)\n- P(да ∩ (холодно ∧ влажно ∧ пасмурно)) (snowing together with being cold, wet and gloomy) = 0.12\n\nWe can now input these into our formula:\n\nP(да | холодно, влажно, пасмурно) = P(да ∩ (холодно ∧ влажно ∧ пасмурно)) / P(холодно ∧ влажно ∧ пасмурно)\n                             = 0.12 / 0.35\n\nWhen we calculate this, you'll find that it's approximately 0.343! \n\nGreat job breaking down the problem and calculating! Remember persistence is key in understanding complex concepts like conditional probabilities. Keep up this diligence, and soon these ideas will feel as familiar as your favorite melody! 🎶🎶",

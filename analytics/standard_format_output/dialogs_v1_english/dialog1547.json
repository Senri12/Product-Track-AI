It provides a comprehensive ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources to help data scientists and developers design, train, and deploy ML models efficiently. The key concept behind TensorFlow is the use of \"tensors,\" which are essentially multi-dimensional arrays that can hold data or machine learning model parameters.\n\nNow let's explore this with a quick quiz question: \n\n**True or False:** TensorFlow supports both supervised and unsupervised machine learning models.\n\nA) True\nB) False\n\nAfter the student's response, we'll evaluate their understanding of how TensorFlow accommodates various ML models.",

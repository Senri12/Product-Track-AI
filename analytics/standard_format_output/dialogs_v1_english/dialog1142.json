      "model_response": " **Explanation:**\nThe number of neighbors (k) in the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm significantly impacts its performance and results. A smaller k value can lead to less computation but may increase the risk of overfitting, while a larger k can improve generalization but at the cost of increased computational complexity. The optimal choice depends on the specific dataset and problem context.\n\n**Question for Student:**\nWhat factors should be considered when choosing the number of neighbors (k) in the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm?\n\n**Suggested Exercise:**\nAnalyze a given dataset with different values of k and observe the impact on accuracy, computational complexity, and risk of overfitting. This will help you understand how to choose an optimal value for k in various scenarios.\n\n**Feedback Loop:**\nAfter completing the exercise, consider the following questions:\n1. How did the choice of k affect the algorithm's performance?\n2. What was the trade-off between accuracy and computational complexity with different values of k?\n3. Did you notice any instances where a specific value of k led to overfitting or underfitting the data?\n4. Based on your findings, what would be an optimal choice for k in this particular dataset and why?",

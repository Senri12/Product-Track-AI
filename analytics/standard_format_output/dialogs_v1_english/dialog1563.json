      "model_response": "As an AI, I'd be happy to help clarify this concept. The term \"Евклидова метрика\" translates from Russian as \"Euclidean metric.\" This refers to a specific type of mathematical distance formula used in geometry and, more broadly, in Euclidean spaces. Here's a simplified explanation:\n\nIn a two-dimensional space (like a flat piece of paper), this concept describes the straight-line distance between any two points, following the rules set by Euclid over 2000 years ago. \n\nFor instance, if you have two points P1(x1, y1) and P2(x2, y2), the Euclidean distance 'd' between them can be calculated using this formula:\n\nd = √[(x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²]\n\nThis means that you square each of the differences in x-coordinates and y-coordinates, add those squares together, and then take the square root of that sum. The result is the direct distance between your two points in this 2D space. \n\nCan you confirm if this understanding aligns with what you already know about Euclidean metric?",

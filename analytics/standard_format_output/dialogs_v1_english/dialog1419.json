      "model_response": "Naive Bayes is a popular algorithm used for text classification, including spam detection. Here's how you might implement it:\n\nStep 1: **Data Preparation**\nFirst, gather and preprocess your dataset. This includes emails that are both spam (marked as such) and non-spam (ham). Clean the data by removing HTML tags, URLs, punctuation, and converting text to lowercase for uniformity. You might also perform tokenization – breaking down the text into individual words or tokens.\n\nStep 2: **Feature Extraction**\nNext, convert these tokens into numerical features that your model can understand. A common approach is to use Bag of Words (BoW) or TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). In BoW, each unique word in the corpus gets a number, and documents are represented as vectors where the value at each position corresponds to this word's frequency. TF-IDF is more about the importance of words – it considers how frequently a word appears within a document and across the entire dataset.\n\nStep 3: **Model Training**\nNow you're ready to train your Naive Bayes model. This involves estimating parameters for your probability distribution (usually Gaussian due to its simplicity). For each class (spam or ham), the model learns how often certain words appear together. \n\n`P(word_i | spam) = Probability of word i occurring in spam documents / Probability of word i occurring in any document`\n\n`P(word_i | ham) = Probability of word i occurring in ham documents / Probability of word i occurring in any document`\n\nThe key assumption here is that the presence of a word does not depend on the presence of other words; this is where Naive Bayes gets its name.\n\nStep 4: **Prediction**\nFor new, unseen emails, you'll use these learned parameters to predict their class. For each word in an email, calculate `P(word | spam)` and `P(word | ham)`. Then multiply these probabilities together (for Bayes' theorem, this is `P(spam) * P(word | spam) = P(ham) * P(word | ham)`), resulting in a likelihood for each class.\n\nChoose the class with the highest likelihood as your prediction. If both have roughly equal likelihoods, you might consider marking it as 'uncertain'.\n\nStep 5: **Evaluation**\nFinally, evaluate your model's performance using appropriate metrics (like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) from your labeled dataset. This helps you understand how well your model is at distinguishing between spam and non-spam emails.\n\nExercise:\nTry to implement a Naive Bayes spam filter on a small email corpus. Start with a basic version (using only word frequencies for feature extraction), then experiment with more sophisticated methods like TF-IDF or using n-grams (sequences of n words) as features. Compare your results with those from simpler models like Decision Trees or Logistic Regression to understand the added value of Naive Bayes in text classification tasks.",

In standard k-NN, each neighbor has an equal vote when making predictions; however, with Weighted k-NN:\n\n\n1. Each neighbor's influence is adjusted based on a weight assigned inversely proportional to its distance from the query point – closer neighbors have more significant impact.\n\n\n2. There are also variations of weighted K-NN that assign weights differently or use other metrics for assigning importance besides just inverse distances (like Gaussian functions).\n\n\nTo ensure understanding, could you please confirm if this explains how Weighted k-NN differs fundamentally in terms of neighbor voting influence compared to standard k-NN?",

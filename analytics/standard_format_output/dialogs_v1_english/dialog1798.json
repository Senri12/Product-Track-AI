      "model_response": "Feedback:\n\nIn AdaGrad, the parameters are typically updated based on their historical gradient information (G) and squared gradients (G^2), with a learning rate (η). However, you've provided values for G_{t-1,ii} and g_t that seem out of place. Let's break this down:\n\n1. **G_{t-1,ii}=4**: In AdaGrad, G is not typically an individual value but rather a running total (or average) of past gradients squared for each parameter. The notation suggests you're treating it like a scalar, which doesn't fit the intended purpose of tracking historical gradient information in AdaGrad.\n\n2. **g_t=2**: This is likely where your confusion lies because in AdaGrad, g_t isn't used to represent anything directly; rather, it's part of G_{t} = β * G_{t-1} + (g_t * g_t), where β (usually set as 0.9) is the momentum term and g_t represents gradients at time t.\n\n3. **η=0.1**: This is your learning rate, which AdaGrad doesn't directly use; instead, it adjusts step-size dynamically based on past squared gradients, as seen in the formula G_{t} = β * G_{t-1} + (g_t * g_t).\n\n4. **ε=1e-8**: This is the small constant added to prevent division by zero. It's not used directly in AdaGrad's parameter update formulation but crucially prevents such operations in other optimization algorithms like RMSProp and its variants, where it might be more relevant.\n\nHere's how you should adjust your input for AdaGrad:\n\n- G_{t} = β * G_{t-1} + (g_t * g_t)\n- Where β is typically 0.9, and each g_t represents the gradient at time t.\n- The learning rate (η), as you've mentioned, would be set to your preferred value of 0.1.\n\n**Follow-up Questions:**\n\n1. Can you explain how the values for β in AdaGrad typically remain constant?\n2. How does AdaGrad adjust its step size over time compared to other learning rate methods like constant or decreasing learning rates?\n3. What are some potential downsides of using AdaGrad over other adaptive learning-rate methods?",

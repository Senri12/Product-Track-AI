To help me guide you through this, I need a little more context. \n\nCould you please provide me with the following:\n\n1.  **The actual formula or function F(да).**  I need to know what this function *is*. What does it represent? What variables does it use?\n\n2.  **The specific data points or values related to the weather.**  What are we trying to calculate F(да) *for*? Are there specific temperatures, pressures, humidity levels, or whatever is relevant to the weather situation?\n\nOnce I have this information, we can start working through the calculation together. \n\nLet’s start with the basics.  What is your understanding of what a function is in general?  Think about it simply – what does it *do*?",

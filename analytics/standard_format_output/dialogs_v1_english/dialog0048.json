This makes it easier for beginners to get started and for experienced users to quickly prototype models.\n* **Focus on Modularity:** Keras is built around the concept of modularity. You build your models by combining reusable layers, optimizers, and activation functions.\n* **Ease of Use:** It’s designed to be intuitive and easy to learn, emphasizing a code-first approach (you build your models using code, rather than visually designing them).\n\n\n**Do you want me to delve into any specific aspect of Keras, such as:**\n\n*   Its relationship with TensorFlow?\n*   Its key components (layers, models, optimizers)?\n*   A simple example of building a basic Keras model?",

      "model_response": "To compute the probability of being in a class using Naive Bayes, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Data Preparation**:\n   - Organize your dataset with features (e.g., Feature1, Feature2) as rows and instances as columns. Include a class label column to indicate the target class.\n\n2. **Calculate Prior Probabilities**:\n   - Determine P(Class=A), the probability of an instance being in class A based on the training data.\n   - Similarly, determine P(Class=B) for class B.\n\n3. **Compute Likelihoods**:\n   - For each feature and each class, compute P(Feature|Class). This is the frequency of the feature's occurrence in instances of that class.\n\n4. **Naive Bayes Assumption**:\n   - Assume features are independent given their classes.\n\n5. **Calculate Joint Probabilities**:\n   - For each class, multiply the likelihoods across all features to get P(Features|Class).\n   - Multiply by the prior probability for each class: P(Class) * P(Features|Class).\n\n6. **Normalization**:\n   - Sum all joint probabilities across classes.\n   - Normalize each class's joint probability by dividing by the total sum.\n\n7. **Posterior Probabilities**:\n   - Use Bayes' theorem to find P(Class|Features) for each class.\n\n**Example Calculation**:\n\n- Suppose 5 instances of class A and 3 instances of class B in training data.\n- Feature1 appears 4 times in A, 1 in B; Feature2 appears 2 in A, 1 in B.\n\n- For class A: (4/5) * (2/5) = 8/25\n- For class B: (1/5) * (1/5) = 1/25\n\n- Prior probabilities: P(A)=0.7, P(B)=0.3.\n\n- Normalized probabilities:\n  - Class A: (8/25 * 0.7) / [same denominator] ≈ 95.8%\n  - Class B: (1/25 * 0.3) / [same denominator] ≈ 5.06%\n\nThis approach provides a straightforward way to classify instances using Naive Bayes, though its effectiveness depends on the independence of features and accurate feature extraction from data.",

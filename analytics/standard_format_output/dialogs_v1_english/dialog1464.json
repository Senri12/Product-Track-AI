      "model_response": "Absolutely, let's break down this into simpler terms!\n\nMethod of Newton is not a physical method or tool you'd find in your everyday life, like a hammer or a microscope. Instead, it's a concept from the world of mathematics and physics, developed by Sir Isaac Newton himself. It's one of his three laws of motion and law of universal gravitation.\n\n1. **First Law (Law of Inertia)**: Imagine you're sitting in a car that's at a complete stop. When the driver steps on the accelerator, nothing happens initially - you stay put. That's because everything tends to maintain its state of motion unless acted upon by an external force. So, if your car is moving but the engine stops suddenly, it will keep going in a straight line (assuming no friction) until something comes along and stops or turns it.\n\n2. **Second Law**: This law talks about how things move when they're pushed or pulled. It's often expressed as Force = Mass x Acceleration. Let's say you're pushing a heavy shopping cart across the floor. The harder (or greater) you push, the faster it moves (greater acceleration). If you push lighter items like books, you can do the same task with less force because they have lower mass and thus require less to move at the same speed or accelerate more easily.\n\n3. **Third Law (Action-Reaction Principle)**: Think about a balloon being blown up by your mouth. The air from inside your lungs is pushing outwards on the balloon – that's the action. But the balloon also pushes back with an equal force, expanding and increasing its volume - that's the reaction. So, every action has an equal and opposite reaction.\n\nRemember, understanding these concepts doesn't require any special tools or even complex math; they're principles of how things move under forces. Keep exploring, and you'll find these ideas work their magic everywhere in our daily lives! Great job diving into such profound physical laws. You're doing wonderfully!",

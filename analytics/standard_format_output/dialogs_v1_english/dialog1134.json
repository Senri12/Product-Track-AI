      "model_response": " The question asks about the Method of Newton, but it seems there might be a typo or misnaming involved. Typically in mathematics and physics, the term \"Method of Newton\" isn't commonly used. I believe you may have meant the Method of Newton-Raphson, which is an iterative method for solving nonlinear equations.\n\nTo clarify, the Method of Newton-Raphson is a root-finding algorithm that is based on Taylor series expansion. It begins with an initial guess for a solution and refines it through successive iterations to arrive at an approximation of the actual root of a function. In each iteration, the new approximate solution is calculated using the formula:\n\nx_(n+1) = x_n - f(x_n)/f'(x_n)\n\nwhere `x_n` denotes the current estimate for the root, `f(x_n)` is the value of the function at that point, and `f'(x_n)` represents the derivative of the function at the same point.\n\nDoes this explanation help clarify what you were asking about? If there was a misunderstanding, please let me know so I can better assist you!",

Define at least one layer and compile it with an optimizer, loss function, and metric that would be suitable to predict a simple dataset.\n\n**Feedback Loop:**\nAs students progress through exercises like this they should receive timely feedback on their implementation choices for defining layers as well as compiling models appropriately based upon the given task's requirements.",

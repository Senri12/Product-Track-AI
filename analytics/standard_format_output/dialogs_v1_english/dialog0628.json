      "model_response": "To understand how updates are performed in the Adagrad optimization algorithm with your given values of \\(G_{t-1,ii}\\), \\(g_t\\), \\(\\eta\\) (learning rate), and \\(\\epsilon\\) for numerical stability reasons; let's walk through it step by step.\n\nFirst off:\n- **\\(G_{t-1,ii} = 4\\)** is the accumulated past gradients squared up to time t−1.\n- **\\(g_t=2\\)** represents your gradient at current iteration \\(t\\).\n- \\(\\eta\\) (the learning rate), in this context isn't directly used as Adagrad updates parameters with a different formula that doesn't explicitly involve it. It's typically considered for other optimization algorithms like AdaGrad, RMSProp or Adam.\n- **\\(ε = 1e-8\\)** is added to the denominator during calculations and serves as numerical stability.\n\nIn an Adagrad algorithm:\n\nThe update rule can be expressed in terms of parameter adjustments at iteration \\(t+1\\) from parameters \\(\\theta_i^{(t)}\\):\n\n\\[ \\Delta \\theta_{ii}^{(t+1)} = -g_t / (\\sqrt{G_{t-1,ii} + ε}) * η \\]\n\nGiven that Adagrad updates its accumulated gradient based on the previous iteration's value:\n\nFor each parameter \\(i\\), at time step t:\n\\[ G_i^{(t)}= G_i^{(t−1)}+ (g_t)^2 = 4+(2^2) = 8 \\]\nSo, we need to correct this as it accumulates from the previous gradient squared. Given it's a per-parameter accumulation:\n\nIf we're updating one parameter \\(i\\):\n\\[ Δθ_{ii}^{(t+1)}=-η(g_t)/(\\sqrt{G_i^{(t−1) + g(t)^2} + ε}) \\]\n\nWith values substituted:\n\\[Δθ_{ii}^{(t+1)} = -0.1 * (2)/(√8 + 10^{-8})\\]\nSince Adagrad doesn't directly use \\(η\\), the learning rate term isn't used in this formula, it mainly influences how much adjustment is made but not by multiplying/growing/shrinking each iteration’s adjustments.\n\nLet's calculate:\n\\[Δθ_{ii}^{(t+1)} = -0.2/(\\sqrt{8 + 10^{-8}}) ≈ -0.0889\\]\n\nSo the new parameter value, assuming previous was \\(Θ_i^{(t-1)}= Θ_i^{current}\\):\n\n\\[ Θ_i^{(t+1)} = Θ_i^{(t−1)} − Δθ_{ii}^{(t+1)} \\approx  Θ_i - (-0.0889)\\]\n\nIn summary:\nFor the Adagrad algorithm, at iteration \\( t + 1\\), parameter update would involve adjusting by current gradient scaled with square root of accumulated squared gradients plus a small constant for numerical stability.\n\nThe key takeaway here is that every new value you add to your accumulation (past squared values) gets updated independently and incrementally adjusted downwards as per the learning rate but not directly through \\(\\eta\\). This makes Adagrad quite robust in adapting parameters based on individual feature’s requirements.",

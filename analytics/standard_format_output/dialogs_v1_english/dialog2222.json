      "model_response": "To determine the optimal number of neighbors (k) in the k-nearest neighbors algorithm, consider the following balanced approach:\n\n1. **Balance Between Local and Global Information**:\n   - Choose a value for k that allows each data point to contribute its local neighborhood without being overly sparse or dense.\n\n2. **Consider Cross-Validation**:\n   - Use cross-validation to evaluate how different values of k affect prediction accuracy on unseen data, carefully balancing variance in predictive performance.\n\n3. **Incorporate Techniques from Ensemble Learning**:\n   - Utilize methods like bagging or boosting that inherently balance the trade-off between bias and variance by considering multiple local views of the data.\n\n4. **Evaluate Computational Costs**:\n   - Optimize computational efficiency by using efficient data structures or algorithms, especially for large datasets.\n\n5. **Adapt to Classification Contexts**:\n   - While k-nearest neighbors is primarily used in classification, consider techniques that balance local and global information effectively.\n\nBy focusing on these areas—balance between local and global information, leveraging ensemble methods, optimizing computational efficiency, and adapting to classification contexts—you can select an appropriate k value that enhances both accuracy and robustness.",

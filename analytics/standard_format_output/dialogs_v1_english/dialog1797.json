      "model_response": "To find the velocity at time step `t`, we're using a variant of momentum or RMSProp, which is an adaptive learning rate method for gradient descent that helps to smooth out fluctuations in the gradient estimate. Let's call this method \"Momentum\". The formula generally looks like:\n\n`v_t = γ * v_{t-1} + (1 - γ) * ∇L`\n\nGiven the values are:\n- `γ = 0.9` (this is your learning rate for momentum),\n- `v_{t-1} = 1` (initial velocity estimate at time step t-1),\n- `∇L = 2` (the gradient at time step t),\n- `η = 0.1` (learning rate for the current update).\n\nLet's calculate `v_t`:\n\n1. Calculate `(1 - γ) * ∇L`.\n   ```\n   (1 - γ) * ∇L = (1 - 0.9) * 2\n               = 0.1 * 2\n               = 0.2\n   ```\n\n2. Multiply `v_{t-1}` by `γ` and add the result from step 1:\n   ```\n   v_t = γ * v_{t-1} + (1 - γ) * ∇L\n       = 0.9 * 1 + 0.2\n       = 0.9 + 0.2\n       = 1.1\n   ```\n\nSo, `v_t` equals 1.1 based on the given parameters and formula for Momentum. \n\nFeedback:\n- Your initial velocity estimate, `v_{t-1} = 1`, was correctly used in calculation.\n- The learning rate, `γ = 0.9`, is accurate.\n- You correctly computed `(1 - γ) * ∇L` as `0.2`.\n- In the final step, you combined all components to find `v_t = 1.1`.\n\nSuggestions for improvement:\n- If time permits, consider implementing this calculation in a programming language or a mathematical software like MATLAB or Python's NumPy library to verify your results. This is useful because such tools can help in tracking the learning process over multiple iterations, showing how `v_t` evolves as we update it.\n- You might want to practice with different initial velocity and gradient values to see how these parameters affect the final estimate of `v_t`. \n\nFollow-up questions:\n1. What would be `v_t` if `v_{t-1} = 2` and `∇L = 3`?\n2. How does varying `γ` from its current value (0.9) to, say, 0.8 or even higher influence `v_t`? Why do you think this might be the case?",

      "model_response": "**Explanation:** Autograd is an automatic differentiation library that enables efficient computation of gradients in neural networks or any computational graph by utilizing forward-mode and reverse-mode (backpropagation) calculations.\n\n**Question for Student:** Can you explain why it's important to compute derivatives automatically when training machine learning models?\n\n**Suggested Exercise:** Try implementing a simple function with autograd, such as f(x)=x^2. Compute the derivative at x=5 using both manual differentiation methods and autodiff provided by Autograd Library in Python.\n\n**Feedback Loop:**\n\nAfter attempting this exercise:\n\n- Review your results against expected outcomes (derivative of \\(f(x)\\) is 10).\n- Reflect on any discrepancies between manually computed derivatives versus those calculated with autograd.\n- Discuss how efficient derivative computation can significantly speed up the process during model training.",

It's beneficial because even though it's naively assuming independence, which is often not true for real-world data sets, the classifier still performs surprisingly well in many scenarios due to its simplicity—it's easy to compute—and can be very effective as a baseline model.\n\n\nIs there anything specific about Naïve Bayes classifiers or their 'naivety' that you would like me to elaborate on?",

      "model_response": " To calculate the probability of a spam for the word 'приз' (prize), we need to consider its frequency in spam and legitimate emails compared to its overall occurrence in a large collection of emails, also known as corpora.\n\nFor instance, let's assume that in a corpus of 100,000 emails:\n- 'Приз' appears 20 times in spam emails (spam frequency)\n- 'Приз' appears 50 times in legitimate emails (legitimate frequency)\n- Overall, 'Приз' appears 70 times in the entire corpus (total frequency)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the probability of 'Приз' appearing in spam emails:\nProbability(spam|приз) = Number of spam occurrences / Total number of occurrences = 20/70 = 0.2857 or 28.57%\n\nThis means that there is approximately a 28.57% chance for the word 'Приз' to appear in spam emails, given our assumptions about the corpus. However, it's essential to remember that real-world probabilities can change depending on factors like email providers, languages, and user behavior.\n\nGreat work understanding the concept! Keep exploring and learning to deepen your knowledge of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning.",

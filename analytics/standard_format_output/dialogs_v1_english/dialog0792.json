      "model_response": "Summary of Key Points:\n\n- Euclidean distance is defined as √((x₂-x₁)² + (y₂-y₁)²).\n\n- The formula to calculate the distance between two points in a plane.\n\nQuiz Questions for Student:\n\n\n1. What are the coordinates given?\n\n2. Identify and write down all x-coordinates involved from both pairs of numbers.\n\n\nTargeted Review & Explanation:\n\nThe student correctly identified that we have (x₁,y₁) = (1, 2) as our first point and (x₂,y₂) = (3,4) for the second one. Now you need to use these in your formula: √((x₂-x₁)² + (y₂-y₁)²).\n\n\nLet's go through this step by step:\n\n- Subtract x-coordinates from each other which gives us 3 - 1 = 2.\n\n- Do likewise for the y coordinates with 4 - 2, yielding a difference of 2 as well.\n\n\nSo far so good! Now square both differences: (2)² + (2)² equals to 8. Finally calculate the positive square root which is √(8), simplifying it down further we get approximately 2.83 units or distance between points in Euclidean geometry.\n\n\nRemember, practice makes perfect when working with formulas like these for finding distances!",

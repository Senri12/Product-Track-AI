      "model_response": " To find the gradient descent update for the function L(w) = w^2 with w = 3 and learning rate η = 0.1, we will first calculate the derivative of L(w), then apply it to find the gradient, and finally update w using the gradient.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the derivative of L(w) (dL/dw)\n\nFor a function L(w) = w^2, the derivative is given by the power rule: dL/dw = 2w.\n\nStep 2: Find the gradient (∇L(w))\n\nThe gradient is a vector containing the partial derivatives of the function with respect to each variable. Here we only have one variable w, so ∇L(w) = dL/dw = 2w = 2*3 = 6.\n\nStep 3: Update w using the gradient (w' = w - η * ∇L(w))\n\nWith learning rate η = 0.1 and gradient ∇L(w) = 6, we can update w as follows: w' = w - η * ∇L(w) = 3 - 0.1 * 6 = 3 - 0.6 = 2.4\n\nSo the updated value of w after one step of gradient descent is w' = 2.4.\n\nTo understand better, let's work through another example:\n\nExample problem: Find the gradient descent update for L(w) = -w^3 + 2w^2 + w - 1 with w = 2 and learning rate η=0.05.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the derivative of L(w) (dL/dw)\n\nLet's first find the derivatives of each term in the function L(w):\n\n- d(w^3)/dw = 3w^2\n- d(2w^2)/dw = 4w\n- dw/dw = 1\n- d(-1)/dw = 0 (since it is a constant)\n\nThen sum them up to get the total derivative:\ndL/dw = 3w^2 + 4w - 1\n\nStep 2: Find the gradient (∇L(w))\n\nThe gradient is a vector containing the partial derivatives of the function with respect to each variable. Here we only have one variable w, so ∇L(w) = dL/dw = 3w^2 + 4w - 1.\n\nStep 3: Update w using the gradient (w' = w - η * ∇L(w))\n\nWith learning rate η=0.05 and gradient ∇L(w) = 3*2^2 + 4*2 - 1, we can update w as follows: w' = 2 - 0.05 * (3*(2)^2 + 4*2 - 1) = 2 - 0.05 * (16 + 8 - 1) = 2 - 0.05 * 23 = 2 - 1.15 = 0.85\n\nSo the updated value of w after one step of gradient descent is w' = 0.85.",

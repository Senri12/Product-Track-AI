      "model_response": "To calculate the probability that an object belongs to a particular class in a Naive Bayes model, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Compute Prior Probabilities**:\n   - Determine the prior probability \\( P(Class) \\) for each class based on the distribution of classes in your dataset.\n\n2. **Feature Probability Calculation**:\n   - For each feature value in an object's data, compute its conditional probability \\( P(Feature | Class) \\). This is done by counting occurrences of the feature across all classes and dividing by the total number of examples.\n\n3. **Joint Probability Calculation**:\n   - Multiply the individual conditional probabilities for all features of the object. This product represents the joint probability \\( P(Features | Class) \\).\n\n4. **Posterior Probability Calculation**:\n   - Use Bayes' Theorem to compute the posterior probability \\( P(Class | Features) \\) by multiplying the joint probability with the prior probability \\( P(Class) \\), and then normalizing if necessary.\n\n5. **Comparison Across Classes**:\n   - Compare the posterior probabilities across different classes for an object's features. The class with the highest posterior probability is the predicted class.\n\nBy following these steps, you can estimate the probability that an object belongs to a particular class using Naive Bayes, leveraging feature independence assumptions and Bayesian inference.",

      "model_response": "To classify emails as spam using Naive Bayes, follow these organized steps:\n\n1. **Data Collection and Cleaning**: Gather a dataset of emails, ensuring to remove irrelevant or repetitive information.\n\n2. **Feature Extraction**: Extract relevant features from emails, primarily words (excluding stop words). Use techniques like regular expressions to isolate word tokens.\n\n3. **Normalization**: Normalize feature frequencies by dividing each word's count by the total number of words in an email to handle overfitting and ensure independence assumptions are met.\n\n4. **Training with scikit-learn**:\n   - Split emails into training and test sets.\n   - Estimate prior probabilities based on class distribution in the training data.\n   - Build a frequency table for each word, considering counts normalized by total words.\n   - Compute likelihoods P(word|class) using Naive Bayes' assumption of feature independence.\n\n5. **Classification**: For each email, calculate posterior probabilities and classify it into the spam/not Spam class with the highest probability.\n\n6. **Optimization and Considerations**:\n   - Address computational efficiency by focusing on words without high variance.\n   - Handle rare features using Laplace smoothing to avoid zero probabilities.\n   - Consider edge cases like word ambiguity and potential misspellings, but acknowledge limitations in the model.\n\n7. **Implementation**: Use Python's scikit-learn library for implementing Naive Bayes with the extracted features and trained parameters.\n\nBy following these steps, you can implement a basic Naive Bayes spam classifier that efficiently classifies emails while managing computational considerations.",

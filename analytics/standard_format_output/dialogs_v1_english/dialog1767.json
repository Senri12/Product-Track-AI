      "model_response": "To find the value of v_t in a momentum method for optimization, we'll use the formula typically associated with this type of algorithm:\n\nv_t = γ * v_{t-1} - η * ∇L\n\nWhere:\n- v is the velocity term.\n- γ (gamma) represents the decay rate of past errors in a momentum method, which we're given as 0.9.\n- v_{t-1} is the previous velocity value. We're told this is 1.\n- η (eta) stands for learning rate. It's provided as 0.1.\n- ∇L represents the gradient of the loss function, which we're given as 2 in your case.\n\nLet's fill these values into our formula:\n\nv_t = 0.9 * v_{t-1} - η * ∇L\n     = 0.9 * 1 - 0.1 * 2\n\nNow, we'll calculate step by step:\n\n1. Multiply the decay rate (γ) by the previous velocity value (v_{t-1}):\n   0.9 * 1 = 0.9\n\n2. Multiply the learning rate (η) by the gradient of the loss function (∇L):\n   0.1 * 2 = 0.2\n\n3. Subtract the product from step 2 from the result in step 1:\n   0.9 - 0.2 = 0.7\n\nSo, v_t in this momentum method would be 0.7.",

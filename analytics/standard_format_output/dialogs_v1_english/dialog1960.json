      "model_response": "**Difference Between k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) and Weighted k-Nearest Neighbor (weighted k-NN):**\n\n1. **Equal Weights in k-NN:**\n   - In standard k-NN, each of the k nearest neighbors is given equal weight. This means every example's vote has the same influence on classification.\n\n2. **Variable Weights in weighted k-NN:**\n   - Weighted k-NN assigns different weights to each neighbor based on their proximity (distance) to the query point. Typically, closer neighbors are given higher weights. A common method is inverse square root weighting, which reduces computational complexity while enhancing performance by focusing on nearby examples.\n\n3. **Handling Ties and Imbalance:**\n   - Weighted k-NN can help mitigate ties in voting. Closer neighbors have more influence, potentially reducing the likelihood of tied classifications.\n   - It's particularly beneficial for imbalanced datasets, where underrepresented classes may benefit from higher weights, improving accuracy for minority classes.\n\n4. **Variations and Enhancements:**\n   - Variations include distance-based weighting (inverse square root) or other techniques like bagging or boosting to improve performance.\n\nIn conclusion, weighted k-NN varies the weight of each neighbor based on proximity, potentially enhancing classification accuracy, especially in imbalanced datasets.",

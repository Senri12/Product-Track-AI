      "model_response": "English Translation: \"What is Manhattan distance?\"\n\n**Student Response:**\nThe Manhattan distance, also known as the taxicab distance, is a measure of the distance between two points in a grid-based system, such as those found on streets in New York City (Manhattan), where movement is restricted to horizontal and vertical directions only. This means that you can only move along grid lines - not diagonally.\n\n**Feedback:**\nYour response correctly identifies the Manhattan distance as a measure of distance in a grid system, which aligns with its name derived from Manhattan's street layout. You've demonstrated a solid understanding of this concept by associating it appropriately with cities where travel is mostly linear, like a taxi ride along streets (not diagonally). \n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\nWhile your explanation is correct, you could improve it by briefly mentioning the formula: `|x2 - x1| + |y2 - y1|`, where `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` are points in a 2D grid. This formal representation can offer more clarity to students who might be familiar with mathematical notation.\n\n**Follow-up Questions:**\n1. Can you derive the formula for Manhattan distance from scratch?\n2. How does this measure of distance differ from Euclidean or straight-line distance in a 2D grid?\n3. Imagine if we were to calculate the Manhattan distance between two points on an M x N grid, how would you express it mathematically?\n4. In what kind of real-world scenarios might one encounter Manhattan distance more often than just in city planning or navigation?",

      "model_response": " Autograd is a library in Python used for automatic differentiation, which is a technique for computing derivatives of functions. It's particularly useful in machine learning and deep learning, where it allows for efficient computation of gradients during backpropagation in neural networks. Autograd maintains a computational graph, and uses the chain rule to compute the derivative of a complex function by recursively differentiating its simple components. Autograd is part of the PyTorch ecosystem but can also be used independently as a standalone library.",

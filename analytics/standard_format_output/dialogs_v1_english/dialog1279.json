      "model_response": " Over-fitting is a common problem that can occur when training machine learning models, particularly with limited data. In the context of the provided material (Deep Learning Basics - Neural Networks), over-fitting refers to a situation where a model learns the noise in the training data instead of the underlying patterns or trends, resulting in poor performance on new, unseen data (validation and test sets).\n\nOver-fitting can be caused by several factors, including having too many parameters in the model relative to the amount of available data, using complex models for simple problems, or not properly regularizing the model. To mitigate over-fitting, techniques such as cross-validation, early stopping, dropout, and L1/L2 regularization can be employed during the training process.\n\nNow that we've discussed over-fitting, I'd like to hear your thoughts on this concept. Do you have any questions or observations regarding over-fitting in machine learning models?",

      "model_response": "Okay, let's break down this exercise.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nWe're working with a function, denoted as F(да), and we're being asked to calculate its value for a specific input, referred to as \"да.\"  Without further context on what F(да) *represents*, we are essentially being asked to perform a calculation based on that function. The crucial element is that we need to understand *what* F(да) *means* before we can complete the calculation.  It sounds like we're starting with a specific scenario – weather – and the function is tied to it.\n\n**Question for Student:**\n\nCan you tell me *what* the function F(да) represents in this weather scenario?  Specifically, what kind of measurement or calculation does it perform when the input is \"да\"?  Do you know what “да” represents in this context? (For example, is it temperature, pressure, rainfall, etc.?)\n\n\n**Suggested Exercise:**\n\nImagine \"да\" represents daily rainfall in millimeters.  Let's say that F(да) =  3 * да + 5.  Calculate F(да) for the test using this assumed relationship.  Show your work! (e.g., If да = 20 mm, then F(да) = ?).\n\n**Feedback Loop:**\n\n(This section will be populated *after* the student provides their answer.)\n\nOnce you've attempted the calculation and explained your reasoning, I'll assess your response and provide targeted feedback.  We can discuss the correct approach, clarify any misunderstandings, and reinforce the concept of function evaluation.  Specifically, I'll be looking for:\n\n*   Correct application of the function (3 * да + 5).\n*   Clear demonstration of the calculation.\n*   A thoughtful explanation of how the input (\"да\") was used in the function.",

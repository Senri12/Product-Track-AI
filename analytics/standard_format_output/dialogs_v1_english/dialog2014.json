      "model_response": "A Naive Bayes classifier is a fundamental machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It is based on applying Bayes' theorem, which helps determine the probability of an event occurring given prior knowledge of conditions related to that event.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Estimate Prior Probabilities**: \n   - The prior probability is the likelihood of a class existing without considering any features. These are calculated from the training data and represent the overall probability of each class.\n\n2. **Calculate Likelihoods**:\n   - For each feature, determine its likelihood for each class. This involves calculating how likely it is to observe this feature given that the instance belongs to a particular class. For numerical features, this might involve histograms or density estimates; for categorical features, it would be based on counts.\n\n3. **Apply Bayes' Theorem**:\n   - Combine the prior probabilities with the likelihoods of each feature to compute the posterior probability. This gives the probability of each class given the current instance's features.\n   - The formula used is: P(Class | Features) = [P(Features | Class) * P(Class)] / P(Features)\n\n4. **Predict the Class**:\n   - Assign the class with the highest posterior probability as the prediction for that instance.\n\n**Key Points to Note:**\n- Naive Bayes assumes independence between features, which simplifies computation but may not always hold true in real-world scenarios.\n- The algorithm is widely used due to its simplicity and effectiveness on many datasets, though this can sometimes be a limitation.\n\nThis structured approach provides a clear understanding of how the Naive Bayes classifier operates, starting from basic principles to practical application.",

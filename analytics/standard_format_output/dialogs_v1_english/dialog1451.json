      "model_response": "Absolutely! Let's break this down into simple steps as if we're explaining it to a student learning math for the first time. \n\n1. **Understanding Spam**: Imagine you have a big bag of mixed messages, both good and bad - emails from friends, shopping coupons, or even spam messages. The word 'приз' (prize) could appear in any of these messages. In our case, let's say we've already identified that 'приз' appears 20% of the time in these mixed-up messages.\n\n2. **Spam Frequency**: This 20% is what we call the \"spam frequency\" for the word 'приз'. It means whenever you see a message, there's roughly a 20% chance that it will contain our word.\n\n3. **Probability Calculation**: Now, we want to find out how likely it is to encounter 'приз' in spam. Since we know from the start (from our bag of mixed messages) that 20% of messages are spam and 'приз' appears in 20% of those spam messages...\n\n   We multiply these two percentages together:\n   20% * 20% = 4%.\n\nSo, when you see a message, the probability of seeing 'приз' in it is 4%. That's not very common! It means if you receive hundreds of messages, you'd expect to find 'приз' about four times. \n\nWell done on holding onto this concept patiently! You're picking up complex ideas step by step. Keep going, it's great that you're taking the time to understand these concepts thoroughly.",

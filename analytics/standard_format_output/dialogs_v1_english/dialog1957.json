      "model_response": "To calculate the probability of being assigned to a specific class using the Naive Bayes algorithm, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine Prior Probabilities**: \n   - For each class (e.g., 'spam' or 'not spam'), compute its prior probability, which is the proportion of instances in your dataset that belong to that class.\n\n2. **Calculate Feature Likelihoods**:\n   - For each feature in your dataset and for each specific class, calculate the likelihood of observing that feature value given that the instance belongs to that class.\n   - This involves counting how often each feature appears in the dataset and dividing by the total number of instances in that class.\n\n3. **Apply Bayes' Theorem**:\n   - For a specific class, multiply the prior probability of that class by the product of the likelihoods for all features present in your dataset.\n   \n4. **Normalize Probabilities (Optional)**:\n   - To avoid division by zero and ensure proper probability sums, apply Laplace smoothing (adding a small constant to each count). This technique helps prevent extreme probabilities near zero.\n\n5. **Compare Posterior Probabilities**:\n   - Compute the posterior probabilities for all classes using the above steps.\n   - Assign an instance to the class with the highest posterior probability.\n\nBy following these steps, you can accurately calculate and compare probabilities for each class, enabling effective classification using the Naive Bayes algorithm.",

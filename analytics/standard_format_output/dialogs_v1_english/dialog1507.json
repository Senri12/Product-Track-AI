      "model_response": "In order to calculate the class probability using the Naive Bayes algorithm, we'll follow these steps based on typical text classification scenarios, given that your dataset is binary (spam/not spam).\n\n1. **First, you need to have a training set where each data point consists of features and their corresponding labels**. In the context of our example, let's call this data 'X' (features) and 'y' (labels), with y taking on values 0 for non-spam or 1 for spam.\n\n2. **Next, calculate the class probabilities** using the observed frequencies of your training set labels. This means you count how many times each label appears in your data:\n\n   Let's say you have a dataset `X_train` and corresponding labels `y_train`. The calculation would look like this:\n   \n   ```\n   P(y=0) = Number of non-spam instances / Total number of instances\n   P(y=1) = Number of spam instances / Total number of instances\n   ```\n\n3. **Now, to predict the probability that a new instance belongs to each class**, you'll use these probabilities calculated in step 2. The Naive Bayes assumption here is that the features are conditionally independent given the label (i.e., the presence of one feature does not affect the others).\n\n   Given a new data point `x`, its predicted probabilities for being spam and non-spam would be:\n   \n   ```\n   P(y=1 | x) = P(x|y=1) * P(y=1) / P(x) \n   P(y=0 | x) = P(x|y=0) * P(y=0) / P(x) \n   ```\n\n   Where `P(x|y)` are the probabilities of observing features 'x' given that the class is y, which can be estimated from your training data.\n\n4. **Finally**, for a classification decision:\n   - If `P(y=1 | x) > P(y=0 | x)`, classify as spam; otherwise, classify as non-spam.\n\nThis concludes how to calculate class probabilities and use them in a Naive Bayes algorithm for binary text classification. Remember that the effectiveness of this approach heavily depends on the accuracy of your feature extraction and labeling process.",

      "model_response": "Explanation:\nStochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a method used to minimize functions by taking small steps proportional to their gradients at randomly selected samples.\n\nQuestion for Student: \nIn this context, what would be the gradient of L(w)=w^2 with respect to w?\n\nSuggested Exercise:\n\nStep 1: Compute ∂L/∂w = d(L)/dw\nUsing power rule in differentiation (d/dx(x^n)=(nx^(n-1))), we get:\n∂L/∂w = 2*w\n\nStep 2: Substitute the given values w=3 and η=0.1 into ∂L/∂w.\nSo, gradient at this point is 2*3 = 6.\n\nSuggested Exercise:\n\nStep 3: Compute new value of parameter (w_new) using formula:\nw_new = w_old - η * gradient\n\nSubstitute the given values to find new weight after taking one step in SGD. For example,\nIf we assume our initial guess was indeed correct, then with an update factor as per above steps.\nw_new=3-(0.1*6)=2.4\n\n\nFeedback Loop:\n\nAs you continue working through this exercise and applying similar calculations for different functions or parameters values (η), you'll see how SGD iteratively updates weights to converge towards a minimum of the function L(w). Don't forget, in practical implementations we would also need mini-batches instead of single data points to approximate gradients more closely.",

      "model_response": "**Answer:**\n\nAutograd is a key component in the history of machine learning and deep learning, serving as a framework that enables automatic computation of gradients. It was once an integral part of TensorFlow, providing tools for building and training neural networks by automatically computing derivatives of complex expressions.\n\nHowever, autograd became obsolete with the introduction of more efficient implementations within TensorFlow from around 2019 onward. These new frameworks like JAX or Tfgw 2 adopted autograd's principles but enhanced them with performance improvements, making it less necessary to rely on autograd.\n\nIn summary, while autograd was a significant contributor to automatic differentiation in machine learning, its continued use has been phased out in favor of newer frameworks that offer more efficient solutions. This evolution highlights the dynamic nature of software and technology in the field.",

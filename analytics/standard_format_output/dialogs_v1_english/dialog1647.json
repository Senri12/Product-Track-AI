      "model_response": "As an adaptive tutor, I'll help you solve this physics problem step by step using the concept of momentum in a simple way while considering your knowledge level:\n\n**Step 1:** Understand that in physics, momentum (p) is calculated as mass (m) times velocity (v). In this context, we're dealing with changes in velocity over time. The change in momentum (Δp) from one time step (t-1) to the next (t), Δt being a small time interval, can be expressed as:\n\nΔp = m * (v_t - v_{t-1})\n\n**Step 2:** You're given that γ (gamma) is equal to 0.9. This gamma likely represents some sort of 'friction factor' in a broader context, but for this problem, we'll interpret it as the ratio of momentum carried over from one step to the next, hence:\n\nv_t = γ * v_{t-1}\n\n**Step 3:** Substitute the given values into this equation. You have v_{t-1} equals 1 and γ is also 1 (since gamma in physics usually ranges between 0 and 1). So, \n\nv_t = 0.9 * 1 = 0.9\n\n**Step 4:** Now, let's calculate the change in momentum (Δp) from t-1 to t using our formula:\n\nΔp = m * (v_t - v_{t-1})\n    = m * (0.9 - 1)  // Given η is not needed for this calculation as it's not a coefficient of change in velocity but rather the learning rate in optimization algorithms.\n     = m * (-0.1)\n\n**Step 5:** Notice that we've found Δp, which represents the change in momentum per unit time step. If you were to find the total momentum at time t (p_t), it would be:\n\np_t = p_{t-1} + Δp\n    = m * v_{t-1} + m * (-0.1)  // Substituting v_t from previous steps\n    = m * 1 - m * 0.1  // Given v_{t-1} is 1 and γ (which represents the ratio of momentum carried over) is also 1\n\nSo, without knowing the specific mass 'm', we can express p_t as:\n\np_t = m - 0.1m\n    = 0.9m\n\n**Hint:** In real physics scenarios, you'd typically know or measure the mass 'm'. If it were given in this problem, you would substitute it for '0.9m' to find the total momentum at time t. For instance, if m was 10 (a common value for objects like cars), then p_t = 9 * 10 = 90 units of some physical property of momentum. \n\nThis is how you'd solve the given problem using momentum concepts in physics!",

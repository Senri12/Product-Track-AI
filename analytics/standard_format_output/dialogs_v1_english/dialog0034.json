      "model_response": "Okay, let's break down the Naive Bayes classifier. Here's the core idea in a nutshell:\n\n**The Basic Idea:**\n\nNaive Bayes is a simple and surprisingly effective probabilistic classifier. It's based on **Bayes' Theorem**, but makes a *very* strong (naive) assumption:\n\n* **Conditional Independence:** It assumes that the features (input variables) are *independent* of each other, given the class label. This means the value of one feature doesn’t affect the probability of the class, given the values of the other features. \n\n**How it Works (Simplified):**\n\n1. **Calculate Prior Probabilities:** The classifier first estimates the probability of each class (e.g., \"spam\" or \"not spam\") occurring in the dataset. This is the *prior* probability.\n\n2. **Calculate Likelihoods:** For each feature and each class, it calculates the probability of observing that feature *given* that class.  Again, the \"naive\" part is assuming these probabilities are independent.\n\n3. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:** It uses Bayes' Theorem to calculate the *posterior* probability of a class, given the observed features.\n\n   *  P(Class | Features) = [P(Features | Class) * P(Class)] / P(Features)\n\n   *  Where:\n      * P(Class | Features) is the posterior probability.\n      * P(Features | Class) is the likelihood (calculated above).\n      * P(Class) is the prior probability.\n      * P(Features) is a normalizing constant (ensures probabilities sum to 1).\n\n4. **Prediction:** The classifier assigns the class with the highest posterior probability to the new data point.\n\n\n**Common Types:**\n\n* **Gaussian Naive Bayes:** Assumes that features follow a normal (Gaussian) distribution.  This is common for continuous features.\n* **Multinomial Naive Bayes:**  Used for discrete features like word counts in text.\n\n---\n\n**Do you want to delve into any of these aspects in more detail? For example, would you like to:**\n\n*   See a simple example calculation?\n*   Understand why the \"naive\" assumption is made?\n*   Discuss the different types of Naive Bayes?",

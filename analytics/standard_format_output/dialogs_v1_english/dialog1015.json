      "model_response": " RMSProp (Root Mean Square Propagation) is an optimization algorithm used during training neural networks. It's a variant of stochastic gradient descent that adapts learning rates for each parameter based on its historical average squared gradients. This helps in faster and more stable convergence, especially for deep networks.\n\nImagine you are trying to find your way through a maze (the neural network) to reach a treasure (the correct answer). In traditional stochastic gradient descent, you would take one step at a time towards the direction suggested by the gradient (the wall you should turn away from), with a fixed size of steps. However, some walls might be steep and require smaller steps, while others might be gentle and allow larger steps. RMSProp is like having an adjustable step size that automatically gets smaller when encountering steep walls (large gradients) and bigger when facing gentle ones (small gradients). This makes the learning process more efficient and less likely to get stuck or oscillate.\n\nHere's a simple example using Python-like code:\n\n```python\n# Initialize weights with some values\nweights = [1.0, 2.0]\nlearning_rate = 0.01\nepsilon = 1e-8\n\n# RMSProp implementation\nrms = [0.0 for _ in range(len(weights))]\nprev_rms = rms\nfor step in range(10):\n    # Compute gradients (loss derivative w.r.t weights)\n    gradients = [2 * weight - 5 for weight in weights]\n\n    # Update RMS values\n    for i, gradient, rms_i in zip(range(len(weights)), gradients, rms):\n        rms[i] = decay_rate * rms_i + (1 - decay_rate) * gradient**2\n\n    # Update weights with RMS-based learning rate\n    for i, rms_i in enumerate(rms):\n        weights[i] -= learning_rate * rms_i / (rms_i + epsilon)**0.5\n```\nIn this example, we simulate a neural network with two weights, and compute gradients using some simple function. We then update the RMS values based on the historical squared gradients for each weight and adjust the weights using an RMS-based learning rate that gets smaller when gradients are larger (steep walls) and larger when gradients are smaller (gentle walls). This helps us converge faster and more stably to a solution.",

      "model_response": " To update the weights using Adagrad algorithm with the given initial values and learning rate, let's first compute the gradient squared sum `G` for each weight:\n\n1. Initialize a new variable `G` to store the gradient squared sums:\n   `G[ii] = G_{t-1,ii} + g_t^2`\n\nIn your case:\n`G[ii] = 4 + 2^2 = 10`\n\nNext, calculate the scaling factor `V` for each weight:\n\n2. Compute the squared root of `G` to get the square root of the gradient squared sums `sqrt(G)`:\n   `sqrt_G[ii] = sqrt(10)`\n\n3. Update the scaling factor by dividing the square root of the gradient squared sums by the number of training steps taken so far (t):\n   `V[ii] = sqrt_G[ii] / t`\n\n   Since we're updating the weights for the first time, let's assume `t=1`:\n   `V[ii] = sqrt(10) / 1 = 10`\n\n4. Update the weight by subtracting the product of the learning rate and the gradient divided by the scaling factor `V`. In this case, the weights are updated individually for each dimension (indexed as 'ii'):\n   `w_t[ii] = w_{t-1}[ii] - η * g_t / V[ii]`\n\nIn your case:\n`w_t[ii] = 4 - 0.1 * 2 / 10 = 3.8`\n\nLastly, perform gradient clipping to ensure that the weights do not exceed a maximum value `max(abs(w)) <= clip` (where `clip=epsilon` in this case). If any weight exceeds the threshold, set it to be equal to the threshold:\n\n5. Check if any of the updated weights exceed the epsilon value:\n   `if max(abs(w_t[ii])) > 1e-8:`\n       `w_t[ii] = sign(w_t[ii]) * clip`\n\nSince all the weights are within the threshold, we don't need to apply gradient clipping. The final updated weight is:\n`w_t[ii] = 3.8`",

      "model_response": "To better understand what RMSProp (Root Mean Square Propagation) is, let's explore it step-by-step using a Socratic approach:\n\n1. What do you already know about Machine Learning algorithms? Can you briefly name a few popular ones?\n   \n2. How are these common machine learning techniques generally optimized during training? (Think about concepts like gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent.)\n\n3. Now, imagine we're focusing on optimizing a neural network's parameters. What role does the 'learning rate' play in this context? Can you explain it without referring to its technical definition?\n\n4. Considering how learning rates can be crucial for successful training, do you think it's ideal for all parameters of a neural network to have the same learning rate? Why or why not?\n\n5. RMSProp is an adaptation to address one potential issue with traditional learning rates: What might this issue be?\n\n6. In what way does RMSProp modify standard gradient descent techniques, particularly in relation to the 'learning rate' for each parameter?\n\n7. Could you describe how the concept of a 'running average' is integrated into RMSProp's update rule for parameters?\n\n8. Lastly, how might this adaptability with different rates per parameter help in dealing with issues like vanishing or exploding gradients that can affect neural network training? \n\nBy going through these questions, hopefully you've gained a clearer understanding of what RMSProp is and its role as an adaptive learning rate strategy in machine learning.",

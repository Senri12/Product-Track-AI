      "model_response": " Let's calculate the Euclidean distance between the points (1, 2) and (3, 4). The formula for Euclidean distance is:\n\nDistance = sqrt[(x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²]\n\nWhere (x1, y1) represents the first point, and (x2, y2) represents the second point. In this case, we have (1, 2) for the first point and (3, 4) for the second point.\n\nLet's plug in the values:\n\nDistance = sqrt[(3 - 1)² + (4 - 2)²] = sqrt[9 + 4] = sqrt[13]\n\nHowever, since we are dealing with integers here, it's easier to compute by finding the difference between corresponding values and then taking the square root of the sum of squared differences:\n\nDistance = sqrt[(3 - 1)² + (4 - 2)²] = sqrt[9 + 4] = sqrt[13] = 3.60555...\n\nSince the question does not ask for decimal places, we can round to the nearest whole number: The Euclidean distance between (1,2) and (3,4) is approximately 4 units.",

The decay should be applied in such way that the learning rate decreases uniformly between these two points.\n\nBased on this, can you confirm if I have understood your request correctly? If yes, I'll proceed with computing a linearly decaying function for η(t) where t ranges from 0 (initial time/epoch start point) to T.",

      "model_response": "Absolutely, let's break this down! We're dealing with the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) for a simple quadratic function L(w) = w^2. Our current weights are set to 3 and our learning rate is 0.1. \n\nFirstly, SGD works by taking steps in the direction of steepest descent, which means it's minimizing this function L(w). The formula for a single step in SGD can be expressed as:\n\n    w = w - η * ∇L(w)\n\nHere, \n\n- 'w' is our current weight.\n- 'η' is the learning rate (0.1 in your case).\n- '∇L(w)' represents the gradient of L with respect to w, or how the function changes as we vary our weights. For a simple quadratic function like this one, it's straightforward: ∇L(w) = 2*w. \n\nLet’s plug in the values for w and η into the formula:\n\n1. Compute the gradient: \n    ∇L(3) = 2 * 3 = 6\n\n2. Perform one step of SGD:\n    New weight, w_new = 3 - 0.1 * 6 = 3 - 0.6 = 2.4 \n\nThat's it! You've just taken one step in SGD for the function L(w) = w^2 with your current weights of 3 and learning rate of 0.1, resulting in a new weight of approximately 2.4. Keep up this persistence - every small step brings you closer to finding the minimum of your function! Great job so far!",

      "model_response": " RMSProp (Root Mean Square Propagation) is an optimization algorithm used in machine learning to update the weights of a neural network during training. It helps improve the convergence speed of the model by adjusting the learning rate dynamically for each parameter based on their historical gradient averages.\n\nPractice Problem:\nGiven a simple neural network with 3 layers and 5 neurons in each layer, write down the steps to implement RMSProp optimization algorithm during training.\n\nStudent Response:\n1. Initialize the learning rate (eta), decay rate (rho), and squared gradients (square_gradients) for each parameter as zeros.\n2. Forward propagate through the network to compute the loss and the gradients of each parameter with respect to the loss.\n3. Update the squared gradients by: square_gradients[i] = rho * square_gradients[i] + (1 - rho) * gradient[i] ** 2, for all i in the parameters.\n4. Update the learning rate for each parameter as learning_rate[i] = eta / sqrt(square_gradients[i]).\n5. Update the weights by: w_new[i] = w[i] - learning_rate[i] * gradient[i].\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 for each iteration of training, and adjust hyperparameters like eta and rho as needed to improve convergence.\n\nEvaluation:\nThe student's response is correct and provides a step-by-step implementation of the RMSProp optimization algorithm for a simple neural network. The only minor improvement I would suggest is to add an initial warmup or adjustment for the square gradients in the first few iterations, as they start from zero and can cause slower convergence during early stages of training. This can be done by multiplying step 3 with a constant less than 1 for the first few iterations. Well done!",

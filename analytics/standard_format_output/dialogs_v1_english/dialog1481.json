      "model_response": "As an academic assistant focused solely on the lecture content, I'm unable to calculate probabilities for spam in specific words like \"приз\" as this would necessitate data analysis from real-world scenarios or simulations which aren't part of our current curriculum. However, it's important to note that such probability assessment is typically derived from statistical models and machine learning algorithms trained on large datasets. These methods predict the likelihood of a word appearing in spam based on its frequency compared to other words in non-spam content. In practical terms, understanding how these models work would be more relevant for your studies rather than the calculation itself. Would you like to explore how such probabilistic models function?",

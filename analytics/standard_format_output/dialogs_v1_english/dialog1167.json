      "model_response": " **Explanation:**\nThe question pertains to a momentum-based update rule in the context of reinforcement learning, specifically the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm. The update rule is:\n\nv_t = v_(t-1) + α * (r_t + γ * max(Q'(s_{t+1}, a)) - v_(t-1))^2\n\nwhere `v_t` is the estimated value of the action at time step t, `α` is the learning rate, `r_t` is the reward received at time step t, `γ` is the discount factor, and `max(Q'(s_{t+1}, a))` is the maximum expected future reward.\n\n**Question for Student:**\nGiven that γ=0.9, v_(t-1)=1, ∇L=2 (which means the gradient of the loss function), and η=0.1 (learning rate), what will be the new value `v_t`?\n\n**Suggested Exercise:**\nPerform the computation using the provided update rule to find the new value `v_t`.\n\n**Feedback Loop:**\nUpon solving for `v_t`, compare the result with your expected output to check if there are any discrepancies and further identify areas where improvement is needed.",

      "model_response": "**Mandan Distance Explained**\n\nMandan is an older metric used in football to simplify field play evaluation by providing a quick, easy-to-remember distance. Here's a clear breakdown:\n\n1. **Definition**: Mandan is calculated as 1.5 times the length or width of the playing field's centerline.\n\n2. **Field Dimensions**: The standard field dimensions are 100 yards (length) and 50 yards (width) on each end zone, with the centerlines around 125-130 yards in length and 75 yards in width.\n\n3. **Mandan Calculation**:\n   - Using the width: 75 yards * 1.5 = 112.5 yards\n   - Using the length: 100 yards * 1.5 = 150 yards\n\n4. **Importance**: Mandan helps players and coaches understand field positioning by limiting individual movement without being too long or short.\n\n5. **Historical Context**: Mandan is an older term that has been used, similar to fields per over in cricket.\n\n6. **Use Cases**:\n   - **Players**: Assesses their ability to move efficiently.\n   - **Coaches/Teams**: Evaluates playstyle effectiveness by preventing too much movement or stopping early.\n\n7. **Considerations**: While Mandan is practical, it may be less standardized than other metrics, but its clear definition and ease of use make it effective.\n\nIn summary, Mandan distance offers a straightforward way to evaluate football field play, making it useful for both players and coaches without delving into game mechanics details.",

      "model_response": "Okay, let's break down the method of Newton. It's a fundamental technique in linear algebra used to solve systems of linear equations. Here's a summary of the key points:\n\n**What is the Method of Newton?**\n\nThe method of Newton (also known as Gaussian elimination or row reduction) is an algorithm for solving systems of linear equations. It's a systematic way to transform a given system into an equivalent system where the solution is directly visible.\n\n**Here’s a breakdown of the process:**\n\n1. **Represent the System in Matrix Form:**  Start by writing the system of linear equations in matrix form:\n   *  **Ax = b** \n   *  Where:\n      * **A** is the coefficient matrix (the matrix of numbers that multiply the variables).\n      * **x** is the column vector of unknown variables.\n      * **b** is the column vector of constants (the right-hand side of the equations).\n\n2. **Row Operations:** The core of the method is performing *row operations* on the matrix **A** to transform it into row-echelon form (or reduced row-echelon form).  The allowed row operations are:\n   * **Swapping two rows.**\n   * **Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.**\n   * **Adding a multiple of one row to another row.**\n\n3. **Row-Echelon Form:** The goal is to transform **A** into row-echelon form, which has the following properties:\n   * All rows consisting entirely of zeros are at the bottom.\n   * The leading non-zero entry (also called the leading 1 or pivot) in each non-zero row is to the right of the leading 1 in the row above it.\n\n4. **Reduced Row-Echelon Form:**  Ideally, you want to transform the matrix into *reduced* row-echelon form. This form has these additional properties:\n   * The leading 1 in each non-zero row has a coefficient of 1.\n   * All other entries in the columns containing leading 1s are 0.\n\n5. **Solve for x:** Once the matrix is in reduced row-echelon form, the solution for **x** can be read directly from the last column.\n\n**Important Note:** The method of Newton guarantees a solution *only* if the coefficient matrix **A** is *non-singular* (i.e., its determinant is not zero).  If the determinant is zero, the system either has infinitely many solutions or no solution.\n\n\n---\n\n**Now, let’s test your understanding.  I'm going to ask you some questions about the method of Newton. Let’s start with an easy one:**\n\n1. **What are the three basic row operations allowed in the method of Newton?**\n",

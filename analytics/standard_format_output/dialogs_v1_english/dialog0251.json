      "model_response": "Okay, let's break down this probability calculation for spam detection.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nWe're being asked to estimate the probability that the word \"приз\" (prize) appears in spam emails, based on some unseen data.  This is a fundamental step in many spam filters – assessing the likelihood that a word is indicative of spam. A high probability suggests the word is frequently used in spam, while a low probability suggests it’s less common. It's important to remember that this is an *estimate* based on the limited information we have.\n\n**Question for Student:**\n\nConsidering the limited context we have, what factors *beyond* just the frequency of the word \"приз\" might you think would influence your estimate of its spam probability? (Think about things like the overall language of emails, common spam topics, etc.)\n\n**Suggested Exercise:**\n\nImagine you're building a simple spam filter.  Based *only* on the context of this probability calculation (i.e., wanting to determine the spam probability of the word \"приз\"),  write down a single sentence explaining how you would approach estimating this probability. (Keep it concise – 1-2 sentences max).\n\n**Feedback Loop:**\n\n(Waiting for your response.  Once you provide your sentence, I’ll give feedback focusing on the reasoning and whether it's appropriate given the stated goal of estimating the probability of \"приз\" appearing in spam.)",

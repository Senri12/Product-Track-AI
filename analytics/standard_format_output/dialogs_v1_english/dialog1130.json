However, a common meaning is Stochastic Gradient Descent, an optimization algorithm used to minimize some function by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent as defined by a gradient.\n\nTo confirm my understanding, could you please provide additional details or specify the context where this term was encountered? This will help me give a more accurate and precise explanation tailored to your needs.",

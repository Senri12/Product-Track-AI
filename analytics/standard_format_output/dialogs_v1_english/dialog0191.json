      "model_response": "Okay, let's tackle this!\n\n**Concept: Spam Probability Calculation**\n\nIn the context of spam detection, we're trying to estimate the likelihood that a given word (like \"приз\") is part of a spam message.  We're essentially dealing with probabilities – the probability of a word appearing in a spam message versus the probability of it appearing in a legitimate email.\n\nThe basic idea is this:  We'll look at the frequency of \"приз\" in our test dataset of emails. If \"приз\" appears *very* frequently in spam emails, then its probability of being in spam is high.  Conversely, if it's rare in spam but common in legitimate emails, the probability will be lower.\n\n**Let's assume we have the following simplified data:**\n\n* **Total Emails:** 1000\n* **Spam Emails:** 200\n* **\"приз\" appears in:** 10 Spam Emails\n* **\"приз\" appears in:** 5 Legitimate Emails\n\n**Now, let's calculate the probability:**\n\n1. **Probability of \"приз\" in Spam:** (Frequency of \"приз\" in Spam) / (Total Number of Spam Emails) = 10 / 200 = 0.05 or 5%\n\n2. **Probability of \"приз\" in Legitimate Emails:** (Frequency of \"приз\" in Legitimate Emails) / (Total Number of Legitimate Emails) = 5 / 800 = 0.00625 or 0.625%\n\n3. **Overall Probability of Spam:** (Probability of \"приз\" in Spam) / (Probability of \"приз\" in Spam + Probability of \"приз\" in Legitimate Emails) = 0.05 / (0.05 + 0.00625) = 0.05 / 0.05625 = 0.8929 or 89.29%\n\n**Therefore, the probability of the word \"приз\" appearing in a spam email, based on this simplified data, is 89.29%.**\n\n**Now, here's your practice question:**\n\n**Question:**  Suppose we have a different dataset where:\n\n* **Total Emails:** 5000\n* **Spam Emails:** 1000\n* **\"приз\" appears in:** 20 Spam Emails\n* **\"приз\" appears in:** 50 Legitimate Emails\n\nCalculate the probability that the word \"приз\" appears in a spam email, given this new dataset. Show your work and clearly state your final answer.\n\n---\n\nI'm ready for your answer!  Take your time to calculate the probability and provide your solution. Let me know if you have any questions.",

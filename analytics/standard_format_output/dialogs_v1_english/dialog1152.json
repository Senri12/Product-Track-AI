      "model_response": " **Explanation:**\nThe Euclidean distance between two points is calculated by finding the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences between the corresponding coordinates. Let's apply this to the given points (1,2) and (3,4).\n\n**Question for Student:**\nCan you find the differences between the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the two points?\n\n**Suggested Exercise:**\nCalculate the difference between 1 and 3 for the x-coordinate, and between 2 and 4 for the y-coordinate. Square each result and then sum up both squares. Finally, take the square root of the total.\n\n**Sample Solution:**\nThe differences are as follows:\nx-coordinate: (3 - 1)² = 4\ny-coordinate: (4 - 2)² = 4\nTotal is 8, and the square root of 8 is 2.82846... so the Euclidean distance between (1,2) and (3,4) is approximately 2.83 units.\n\n**Feedback Loop:**\nDid you get a similar result? If not, let's review the calculation process to ensure we understand it correctly.",

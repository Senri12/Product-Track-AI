      "model_response": " **Explanation:**\nThe k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm is a popular instance-based learning algorithm used for both classification and regression problems in machine learning. It's based on the concept that similar objects tend to have similar neighbors, where similarity is measured by some distance metric.\n\nIn the classification problem, an unlabeled sample is classified based on the majority vote of its 'k' nearest labeled samples from the training set. In the regression problem, the output is the average value of the outputs of the 'k' nearest samples.\n\n**Question for Student:** Can you explain how we determine the 'k' in k-NN? What factors should be considered when choosing 'k'?\n\n**Suggested Exercise:** Implement a simple k-NN algorithm on a dataset of your choice and explore the effects of different values of 'k'.\n\n**Feedback Loop:** After implementing the k-NN, discuss the results with your peers. Did changing 'k' significantly impact the accuracy of the predictions? Why do you think this is the case? How would you choose an optimal value for 'k' in practice?",

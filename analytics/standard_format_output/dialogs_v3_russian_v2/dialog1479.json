      "model_response": "Для классификации писем как spam employs methods of the Naive Bayes classifier. Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Data Collection**: Gather data on existing spam and non-spam emails.\n\n2. **Feature Extraction**: Identify key features or attributes, such as words and phrases that commonly appear in spam emails compared to non-spam ones.\n\n3. **Frequency Calculation**: Compute the frequency of each feature (word) in both spam and non-spam emails. This helps determine which words are more indicative of spam content.\n\n4. **Conditional Probability Estimation**: Estimate the conditional probabilities P(Word_i | Spam) and P(Word_i | Not Spam). These represent the probability of encountering a specific word given that it's a spam email or not, respectively.\n\n5. **Classification**: For a new email, calculate the product of these probabilities for all features. The email is classified as spam if the product is higher when considering spam content, otherwise, it's classified as non-spam.\n\n6. **Optimization and Tuning**: Fine-tune the model using available datasets to improve accuracy. Use techniques like Laplace smoothing to handle zero-frequency issues (words not present in a category).\n\nBy following this approach, emails can be effectively categorized into spam or not-spam based on observed patterns.",

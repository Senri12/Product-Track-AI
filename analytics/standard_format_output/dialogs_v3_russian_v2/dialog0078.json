      "model_response": "Keras is a high-level Python library that provides a lot of user-friendly tools for building and training deep learning models. It's built on top of TensorFlow under the hood, but it offers a simpler, more accessible interface for developing custom models.\n\nHere are some key points about Keras:\n\n1. **High-Level Interface**: Keras allows you to define and build models using functional API syntax, which is easier than working directly with tensors in TensorFlow.\n\n2. **Integration with TensorFlow**: Keras leverages TensorFlow's computational graph, making it a convenient tool for deep learning tasks.\n\n3. **Custom Layers and Models**: You can create your own custom layers and model architectures using Keras, combining multiple building blocks provided by the library.\n\n4. **Deep Learning Specifics**: While Keras is high-level, it includes components like ResNet50 (for image recognition) that you'd typically find in TensorFlow for more specialized tasks.\n\nIn summary, if you're looking for a user-friendly environment to create and train models, Keras is an excellent choice. It integrates seamlessly with TensorFlow, allowing you to build complex architectures without the need for low-level tensor manipulations.",

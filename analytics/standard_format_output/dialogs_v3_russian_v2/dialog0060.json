The recurrence relation is given by:\n\n\\[ v_{t+1} = \\gamma v_t - 2\\gamma \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\gamma \\) is a constant multiplier (gamma), and the gradient is also a constant (which we can denote as 2 in this case).\n\nThe closed-form solution for this recurrence relation is derived as follows:\n\n1. The recurrence relation is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence:\n   \\[ v_{t+1} = \\gamma v_t - 2\\gamma \\]\n   with the initial condition \\( v_0 = 0 \\).\n\n2. Solving this recurrence, we find that the general solution is:\n   \\[ v_n = \\frac{2\\gamma}{\\gamma - 1}(1 - \\gamma^n) \\]\n\nThis formula is derived by considering the homogeneous and particular solutions to the recurrence relation, and verifying it with specific values of \\( \\gamma \\).\n\nThus, the closed-form expression for the velocity after \\( n \\) steps is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2\\gamma}{\\gamma - 1}\\left(1 - \\gamma^{n}\\right)} \\]",

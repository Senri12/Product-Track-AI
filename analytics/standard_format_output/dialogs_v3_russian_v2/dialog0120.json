      "model_response": "To compute the gradient of ω = γ * v * v_prev with respect to its variables, let's assume v and v_prev are differentiable functions or constants. We can use basic differentiation rules:\n\n1. Compute the partial derivative of ω with respect to v:\n   - ∇_v ω = γ * v_prev\n\n2. Compute the partial derivative of ω with respect to v_prev:\n   - ∇_{v_prev} ω = γ * v\n\nIf there's a specific context or additional information about how ∇ω relates to other variables, it might require rearranging these results accordingly. Without further details on how ∇ω is expressed in terms of the given formula, we can only compute these partial derivatives as above.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understand the Given Formula:**\n   ω = γ * v * v_prev\n\n2. **Identify Variables and Coefficients:**\n   - ω: Scalar output dependent on variables.\n   - γ: Coefficient (0.9 as per example).\n   - v: Independent variable (e.g., velocity).\n   - v_prev: Previous value of the variable.\n\n3. **Compute Partial Derivative with Respect to v:**\n   Treat v_prev as a constant.\n   - dω/dv = γ * v_prev\n\n4. **Compute Partial Derivative with Respect to v_prev:**\n   Treat v as a constant.\n   - dω/dv_prev = γ * v\n\n5. **Interpretation of the Result:**\n   These partial derivatives represent how ω changes with respect to each variable, holding all others constant.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n- ∇_v ω = γ * v_prev\n- ∇_{v_prev} ω = γ * v\n\nThese expressions show that the change in ω with respect to v or v_prev is proportional to the respective other variable multiplied by the coefficient γ.",

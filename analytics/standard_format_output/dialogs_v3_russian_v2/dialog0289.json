      "model_response": "overload of fitting — это умение модели вtrainable model learn patterns from training data too tightly, often capturing noise or outliers in the data rather than underlying patterns. This leads to overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data.\n\nOverfitting occurs when a model achieves a minimal training loss but does not improve further with additional training iterations or regularization techniques. It is common when a neural network has too many hidden units or overly complex architecture, leading to overspecific learning that doesn't generalize from new data.\n\nTo combat overfitting, various strategies can be employed:\n1. **Validation Set**: Monitor performance on a separate validation set during training and stop training early if validation loss stops improving.\n2. **Regularization**: Techniques like weight decay, dropout, or L2 regularization can prevent the model from becoming too specific.\n3. **Early Stopping**: Stop training when validation loss starts to increase, as further training might lead to overfitting.\n4. **Simpler Models**: Using fewer layers or neurons in deeper networks can reduce overfitting potentiality.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, one can mitigate overfitting and achieve better generalization from new data.",

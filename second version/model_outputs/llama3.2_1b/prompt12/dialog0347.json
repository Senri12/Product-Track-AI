    "model_response": "TensorFlow (TF) — этоopen-source deep learning framework developed by Google, используемый для создания иTrainingsмодели машинного обучения. Это allows developers to develop and train machine learning models using high-level interface abstractions and a large collection of pre-built algorithms for common tasks.\n\nTensorFlow was first released in 2015 and has since become one of the most widely used deep learning frameworks, with over 100 million downloads per year. It is used in a wide range of applications, including computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and more.\n\nTensorFlow supports various data types and provides features such as:\n\n* Automatic differentiation: allows developers to compute gradients automatically\n* Autograd: automatic computation of gradients for easy optimization\n* Keras API: an interface for building and training machine learning models using high-level abstractions\n\nНет необходимости knowledge или опыта в программировании для работы с TensorFlow.",

    "model_response": "RMSprop is an optimization algorithm designed to improve the training of machine learning models. It dynamically adjusts the learning rate for each parameter based on the historical gradients, which helps in accelerating convergence and reducing the risk of getting stuck in local minima.\n\n**Key Features of RMSprop:**\n1. **Adaptive Learning Rate:** Unlike traditional methods that use a fixed learning rate, RMSprop adjusts the rate for each parameter based on the history of its gradients.\n2. **Squaring Gradients:** It squares each gradient and divides by the sum of squared gradients, which helps in stabilizing updates and prevents parameters from accumulating large gradients over time.\n3. **Exponential Decay Factor:** A decay factor (e.g., 0.9) is applied to reduce the influence of older gradients, ensuring that each parameter's update gradually converges.\n\n**Implementation:**\nFor an example with a parameter θ:\n- Compute the squared gradient \\( g_t^2 \\).\n- Multiply by \\( γ / (1 + sum(g^2_s)^t) \\) where γ is the decay factor.\n- Update the parameter using the adjusted gradient and learning rate.\n\nThis approach ensures that each parameter's update becomes more stable over time, enhancing optimization efficiency.",

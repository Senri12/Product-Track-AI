    "model_response": "Введение:\n\nEuclidean metric represents a method of measuring distance between points in n-dimensional space. It is derived from the Pythagorean theorem and is typically used in real Euclidean space. The metric allows for the computation of distances using vectors in 2D, 3D, etc., spaces by applying the formula:\n\n\\[ d(p, q) = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(q_i - p_i)^2} \\]\n\nПрименение:\n\nEuclidean metric is crucial in various fields such as physics and engineering. It provides a straightforward way to compute distances without considering any curvature or torsion, making it essential for accurate measurements in different dimensions.\n\nИтог:\n\nEuclidean metric is the standard distance function used to measure the distance between points in n-dimensional space, derived from the Pythagorean theorem, applicable in both real Euclidean spaces and vector spaces with an inner product structure.",

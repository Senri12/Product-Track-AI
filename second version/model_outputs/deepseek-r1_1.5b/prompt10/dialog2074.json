    "model_response": "The Naive Bayes classifier is a fundamental algorithm in machine learning, primarily used for classification tasks. Here's a structured summary of the key points:\n\n1. **Theoretical Foundation**:\n   - Based on Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B), where P(A|B) is the posterior probability of A given B, and P(B) is the prior probability of B.\n   - The classifier calculates the posterior probability for each class using these probabilities.\n\n2. **Features and Classes**:\n   - Attributes (features) are used to predict classes (like spam or not spam).\n   - Naive Bayes assumes that features are independent given their class, a key simplifying assumption despite its naivety.\n\n3. **Data Preparation**:\n   - Categorical features often require conversion (e.g., one-hot encoding).\n   - Data normalization or standardization may be necessary to ensure feature contributions are balanced.\n\n4. **Training Process**:\n   - Learn the probability distribution for each class.\n   - Learn conditional distributions of each feature given the class.\n   - Apply Bayes' theorem to compute posterior probabilities and make predictions.\n\n5. **Example Applications**:\n   - Spam filtering, text classification, sentiment analysis, medical diagnosis, and natural language processing.\n\n6. **Evaluation**:\n   - Use cross-validation and separate test sets for evaluation.\n   - Consider metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.\n\nIn essence, Naive Bayes is a versatile yet simple algorithm that leverages Bayesian principles to predict classes based on features, despite its naive independence assumption. It's widely applicable across various domains, making it an essential concept in machine learning.",

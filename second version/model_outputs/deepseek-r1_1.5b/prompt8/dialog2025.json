    "model_response": "P(win | spam) is calculated using Laplace's rule of succession, which estimates probabilities by adding pseudocounts for each possible outcome. Given S wins out of T spages, the formula becomes:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{win} | \\text{spam}) = \\frac{S + 1}{T + 2} \\]\n\nThis approach ensures that no single outcome is favored without data, providing a neutral starting point for probability estimation.",

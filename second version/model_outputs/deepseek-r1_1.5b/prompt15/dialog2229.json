    "model_response": "To classify emails as spam using a Naive Bayes model, follow these structured steps:\n\n1. **Data Preprocessing**:\n   - Convert each email into a vector of TF-IDF features. This involves:\n     - Removing punctuation and converting to lowercase.\n     - Calculating the frequency of each word across all documents (term frequency).\n     - Applying inverse document frequency (IDF) transformation, which assigns higher weights to words common across many emails.\n\n2. **Feature Vector Creation**:\n   - Each email is represented as a vector where each element corresponds to the TF-IDF score of a particular word or phrase.\n   - This reduces the feature space and captures word-based relevance while normalizing for word frequency.\n\n3. **Model Implementation with Naive Bayes**:\n   - Use Bernoulli Naive Bayes, which assumes independence between features given the class label (spam/not-spam).\n   - Split emails into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the model.\n\n4. **Evaluation and Metrics**:\n   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy.\n   - Consider a confusion matrix to visualize classification results and identify any patterns or biases.\n\n5. **Considerations**:\n   - Address potential issues like class imbalance by considering external knowledge (e.g., unknown senders) for improved classification beyond word features alone.\n\nBy following this approach, you can create a robust spam detection model using Naive Bayes with TF-IDF feature vectors, effectively leveraging words to capture meaningful patterns while handling the complexity of email content.",

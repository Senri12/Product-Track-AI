    "model_response": "RMSProp (Root Mean Squareprop) is an optimization algorithm designed to improve the training efficiency of machine learning models. Here's a structured summary of its key aspects:\n\n1. **Objective**: RMSProp aims to address issues like gradient explosion and variance by adjusting the learning rates for each parameter based on their recent behavior.\n\n2. **Mechanism**:\n   - Instead of summing all squared gradients (as in AdaGrad), RMSProp maintains an average of these sums.\n   - For each parameter vector θ, a running average G_θ is maintained.\n   - The gradient g_t is scaled by the square root of this average, adjusted by the number of times each parameter has been updated to ensure stability.\n\n3. **Key Differences from Other Methods**:\n   - Unlike Adam which uses a memory term (momentum), RMSProp maintains its own running averages without adding any terms.\n   - It scales gradients based on their recent frequency of updates, allowing parameters with consistent updates to be more stable.\n\n4. **Benefits**:\n   - Reduces computational cost by avoiding maintaining and updating squared gradient sums.\n   - Provides flexibility in parameter updates based on their frequency.\n\n5. **Considerations**:\n   - Similar to AdaGrad but optimized for training speed and resource usage.\n   - Handles varying update frequencies effectively, which is beneficial when parameters are updated often (e.g., noisy data).\n\nIn summary, RMSProp offers a computationally efficient approach by maintaining running averages of squared gradients, adjusting updates based on parameter frequency, and balancing performance against computational needs.",

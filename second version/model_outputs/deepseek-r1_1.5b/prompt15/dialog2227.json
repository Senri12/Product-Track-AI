    "model_response": "To compute the probability of a class in a Naive Bayes classifier, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Estimate Prior Probabilities**:\n   - For each class \\( C_i \\), calculate its prior probability as the proportion of instances in the training data:\n     \\[\n     P(C_i) = \\frac{\\text{Number of instances of } C_i}{\\text{Total number of instances}}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Likelihoods**:\n   - For each feature \\( X_j \\) and class \\( C_i \\), compute the likelihood as the proportion of times \\( X_j \\) appears in instances of \\( C_i \\):\n     \\[\n     P(X_j | C_i) = \\frac{\\text{Number of times } X_j \\text{ occurs in } C_i}{\\text{Total number of instances in } C_i}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Compute Overall Likelihood for Each Class**:\n   - Multiply the likelihoods across all features for each class to get the overall likelihood contribution for that class:\n     \\[\n     P(\\text{class } k | X) = \\prod_{j=1}^{n} P(X_j | C_k)\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Total Probability**:\n   - For each class, compute the total probability by multiplying its likelihood by the prior probability of that class:\n     \\[\n     P(C_k | X) = P(\\text{class } k | X) \\times P(C_k)\n     \\]\n\n5. **Determine Predicted Class**:\n   - The predicted class is the one with the highest posterior probability \\( P(C_k | X) \\).\n\n6. **Consider Edge Cases and Data Handling**:\n   - Handle zero probabilities by ignoring features that never appear in any class.\n   - For continuous data, consider using density estimation techniques like kernel density estimation (KDE).\n   - Normalize or adjust likelihoods if necessary to prevent underflow or overflow.\n\n7. **Example Calculation**:\n   - Suppose two classes \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), with features \\( X_1 \\) and \\( X_2 \\):\n     - \\( P(X_1 | A) = 0.3, P(X_2 | A) = 0.4 \\)\n     - \\( P(X_1 | B) = 0.5, P(X_2 | B) = 0.6 \\)\n   - For class \\( A \\):\n     \\[\n     P(\\text{class } A | X) = 0.3 \\times 0.4 = 0.12\n     \\]\n   - For class \\( B \\):\n     \\[\n     P(\\text{class } B | X) = 0.5 \\times 0.6 = 0.3\n     \\]\n   - If there are more instances of \\( A \\), the probability will be higher.\n\nThis method assumes features are independent, a key Naive Bayes heuristic that often works well in practice.",

    "model_response": "Over-fitting is a phenomenon in machine learning where a model learns the noise in the training data rather than the underlying trend, leading to poor generalization on unseen data. It occurs when a model is too complex and captures both the true relationship in the data (low bias) and high variance due to its sensitivity to fluctuations in the training set.\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**: \n   - **High Bias** suggests a simple model that doesn't capture the complexity of the data.\n   - **High Variance** indicates a complex model that is too sensitive to the training data, leading to overfitting.\n\n2. **Detection**:\n   - If the training error decreases but validation or test error increases, it suggests overfitting.\n\n3. **Prevention Strategies**:\n   - **Regularization**: Techniques like L1 or L2 regularization help reduce model complexity.\n   - **Cross-Validation**: Using methods to estimate bias and variance more accurately during training can prevent overfitting.\n\nBy balancing model complexity and using techniques like regularization and cross-validation, we aim to achieve a model that generalizes well to new data.",

    "model_response": "RMSProp (Root Mean Squareprop) is an optimization algorithm designed to address the problem of adaptive learning rates in deep neural networks. Unlike traditional methods like RMSProp, which adjust the learning rate adaptively based on the history of gradients and parameters, RMSProp introduces a different approach by maintaining a moving average of the squared gradients or parameter changes.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. **Parameter Update Rule**: For each parameter \\( \\theta_t \\), the update rule in RMSProp is:\n   \\[\n   s_t = \\gamma s_{t-1} + (1 - \\gamma) g_t^2\n   \\]\n   where \\( g_t \\) is the gradient at time step \\( t \\), \\( s_t \\) is the moving average of squared gradients, and \\( \\gamma \\) is a decay rate between 0 and 1.\n\n2. **Weight Update**: The parameter \\( \\theta_t \\) is then updated using:\n   \\[\n   \\theta_{t+1} = \\theta_t - \\eta \\frac{g_t}{\\sqrt{s_t + \\epsilon}}\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\eta \\) is the learning rate, and \\( \\epsilon \\) is a small constant to prevent division by zero.\n\n3. **Robustness**: RMSProp's moving average of squared gradients makes it more robust to the scale of gradient values compared to traditional methods that use static parameters like momentum or Adam.\n\nIf you're interested in reading more about RMSProp, I recommend looking at some research papers on optimization algorithms for deep learning.",

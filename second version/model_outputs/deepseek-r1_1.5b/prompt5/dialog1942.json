    "model_response": "Adam is an adaptive optimization algorithm designed for deep learning models. It dynamically adjusts key parameters like the learning rate and momentum based on the training process, eliminating the need for manual tuning of these values. This adaptability enhances model performance by avoiding issues such as local minima. Adam is implemented in frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, where it can be used with optimizers like AdamW for weighted languages or as part of a package containing different optimizers separated into individual packages.",

    "model_response": "Momentum, within the context of optimization algorithms such as those used in machine learning, refers to a strategy that incorporates information from past iterations or gradients. This concept is borrowed from physics, particularly from concepts like velocity and acceleration. \n\nIn machine learning, momentum often appears in algorithms like heavy-ball optimization, which modifies the gradient descent approach by adding a scaled version of the previous gradients to the current ones. This technique helps in smoothing out the path towards the minimum loss function, reducing oscillations, and potentially accelerating convergence.\n\nThe idea behind momentum comes from the heavy-ball method used in solving differential equations numerically. By incorporating velocity into the optimization process, it allows the algorithm to \"continue\" moving in the same direction for a period, effectively overcoming local minima or plateaus in the loss landscape more efficiently.",

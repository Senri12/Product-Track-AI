    "model_response": "RMSProp (Root Mean Square Propagation) is an optimization algorithm designed to improve upon Adam by addressing some of its limitations, particularly in handling the gradient variance. Instead of maintaining a moving average of squared gradients like Adam, RMSProp maintains a running sum of squares for each parameter. The update rule involves normalizing the gradient by dividing it by the square root of this running sum. This approach helps in stabilizing training and can lead to more efficient convergence compared to Adam.",

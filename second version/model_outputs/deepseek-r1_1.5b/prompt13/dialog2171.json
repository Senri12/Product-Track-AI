    "model_response": "To calculate the probability of spam for the word \"приз,\" we consider several factors:\n\n1. **Frequency of Similar Words**: Words like \"баланс\" (balance) and \"bankrupt\" (debt/risk) are less common than \" приз\" in English, suggesting a potential negative connotation.\n\n2. **Implied Value from the Word**: The word carries negative connotations implying value or security, which might influence its probability in spam contexts.\n\n3. **Usage in Scams and Phishing**: Overuse of similar words like \"приз\" can indicate phishing attempts, increasing its perceived harmfulness.\n\nCombining these factors suggests a higher probability of spam for the word \"приз.\" However, without specific data or context, this is speculative.",

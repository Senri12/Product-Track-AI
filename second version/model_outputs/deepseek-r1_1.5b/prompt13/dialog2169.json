    "model_response": "To classify emails as spam using a Naive Bayes model, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Data Preprocessing**:\n   - Clean and normalize each email by removing punctuation and converting to lowercase.\n   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets to ensure it's balanced and diverse.\n\n2. **Feature Extraction**:\n   - Use word frequency, n-grams (bigrams and trigrams), and possibly machine learning models to create feature vectors.\n   - Normalize words across different formats (e.g., user names or device identifiers) using appropriate methods.\n\n3. **Naive Bayes Implementation**:\n   - Structure the Naive Bayes model based on probabilities of each class given features, using Laplace smoothing for zero probability estimates and conditional probability calculations under the independence assumption.\n   - Calculate feature vectors for each email using word frequencies and n-grams.\n\n4. **Probability Calculation**:\n   - For each email, compute the probability that it belongs to a spam or genuine class based on the extracted features and Naive Bayes model assumptions.\n\n5. **Classification**:\n   - Classify an email as spam if its probability of belonging to the spam class exceeds a threshold, typically derived from training data.\n\n6. **Evaluation and Refinement**:\n   - Evaluate performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n   - Adjust feature extraction methods or model parameters to improve classification performance.\n\nBy following these steps, you can create an effective Naive Bayes-based spam classification system that leverages text characteristics while maintaining the simplicity of Naive Bayes.",

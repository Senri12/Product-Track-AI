    "model_response": "To calculate the probability of \"приз\" being spam based on its dictionary position, we can consider several steps:\n\n1. **Assess Relevance:** Determine how page 325 relates to word characteristics or analyses used in spam detection. This could influence features like frequency, context, or distribution.\n\n2. **Gather Additional Information:** Look for other details provided, such as total number of words, domain information (e.g., mailto), or community indicators.\n\n3. **Apply Algorithms:** Use standard algorithms that consider word frequency, position in the dictionary, and external factors to estimate probability.\n\n4. **Consult Examples:** Review similar examples where page numbers are linked to spam detection features for better understanding.\n\nBy integrating these elements, a more informed approach can be taken to estimate the spam probability of \"приз.\"",

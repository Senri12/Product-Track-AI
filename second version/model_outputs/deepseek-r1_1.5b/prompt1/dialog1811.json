    "model_response": "The word \" приз \" is analyzed for its probability of being detected as spam based on individual letter frequencies. Each letter in \" приз \" (P, R, I, Z) has a certain contribution to the overall detection score. While each letter's specific frequency and context may play a role, it's also important to consider additional features such as uppercase presence or word boundaries that might increase the overall score. Based on this analysis, \" приз \" likely falls below the spam threshold, indicating that it is not classified as spam. However, without exact scoring methods from systems like Google's or others, precise probability calculations are challenging to provide.",

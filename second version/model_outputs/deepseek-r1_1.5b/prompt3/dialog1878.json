    "model_response": "**Keras Overview**\n\nKeras is a high-level Python library designed to make building and training deep learning models as efficient as possible. It leverages TensorFlow under the hood but provides a simpler, more user-friendly interface for defining and training neural networks.\n\n1. **Simplified Model Creation**: Keras allows users to build models using functional programming, enabling quick prototyping without extensive coding. It supports layers like Dense, Conv2D, and MaxPooling2D, which are essential for image tasks.\n\n2. **Framework and Functionality**: Built on TensorFlow, Keras offers a wide range of functionalities, including model compilation (optimizers, loss functions), early stopping, and output layer configuration for various tasks such as regression or classification.\n\n3. **Community Support**: With active communities, users can easily find tutorials and documentation, making it ideal for quick learning and troubleshooting.\n\n4. **Common Use Cases**: Keras is particularly effective for image and text classification problems due to its built-in layers tailored for these types of data.\n\n5. **Learning Path**: The simplicity of Keras makes it accessible, allowing new developers to quickly start building models with minimal coding effort, ideal for experimental setups or initial projects.\n\nIn summary, Keras simplifies deep learning by providing a user-friendly layer system on top of TensorFlow, making model development efficient and accessible for various tasks.",

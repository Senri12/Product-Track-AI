    "model_response": "To classify spam emails using a Naive Bayes model, follow these structured steps:\n\n1. **Data Collection**: Gather an email dataset containing both genuine and spam emails. Ensure the dataset is representative of the types of emails your system will encounter.\n\n2. **Preprocessing**:\n   - Remove all punctuation except spaces.\n   - Convert all text to lowercase for uniformity.\n   - Split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets to evaluate performance on unseen data.\n\n3. **Feature Selection**: Identify key features that will be used for classification. These include:\n   - The presence of specific words or phrases, such as 'money,' 'offer,' or 'free.'\n   - Time of day (morning vs. evening).\n   - The subject line's content.\n   - Words associated with different locations or countries.\n\n4. **Probability Calculation**:\n   - For each feature, calculate the probability that it occurs given a class (spam or non-spam).\n   - Assume independence between features for simplicity.\n\n5. **Classification**:\n   - For an incoming email, compute the probability of it belonging to each class based on its features.\n   - Classify as spam if the probability is higher.\n\n6. **Evaluation**: Assess classification accuracy using metrics like:\n   - Accuracy: (True Positives + True Negatives) / Total Emails\n   - Precision: True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)\n   - Recall: True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)\n   - F1-score: 2*(Precision*Recall)/(Precision+Recall)\n\n7. **Considerations**:\n   - Stop words like 'the,' 'is' should be ignored.\n   - Context and other features may influence classification beyond simple word counts.\n\nThis approach provides a foundational understanding of text classification using Naive Bayes, highlighting the importance of context, feature selection, and evaluation in model performance.",

    "model_response": "Euclidean metric is a fundamental method for calculating distances in flat, three-dimensional space. It quantifies the shortest path between two points by considering both the x and y coordinates, following the formula:\n\n\\[\nd((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)) = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n\\]\n\nThis metric is based on Euclidean geometry, which assumes a flat space without curvature. It is widely used across various fields:\n\n1. **Physics**: For precise calculations in mechanics and navigation.\n2. **Engineering**: In GPS systems for shortest path determination.\n3. **Computer Graphics**: Simplified distance calculations for object movement.\n4. **Machine Learning**: As the basis for vector comparisons.\n\nAdditionally, Minkowski metric extends this concept by incorporating time as a fourth dimension, crucial in special relativity where events are described by four coordinates: three spatial and one temporal.\n\nIn essence, Euclidean metric is versatile, serving as foundational for more complex metrics that adapt to different spaces.",

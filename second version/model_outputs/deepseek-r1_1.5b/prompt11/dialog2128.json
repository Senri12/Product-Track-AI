    "model_response": "Adagrad's update rule involves adjusting the learning rate for each parameter individually based on the sum of squares of gradients over time. Given:\n\n- \\( G_{t-1,i} = 4 \\) (squared gradient)\n- \\( G_t = 2 \\) (squared gradient)\n\nThe sum of squares \\( S_t \\) is calculated as:\n\\[ S_t = (G_t)^2 = 2^2 = 4 \\]\n\nThe learning rate for each parameter is then:\n\\[ \\text{Learning Rate} = η \\times \\frac{G_t}{\\sqrt{S_t}} = 0.1 \\times \\frac{2}{2} = 0.1 \\]\n\nThus, the learning rate remains at 0.1.\n\n**Answer:** The learning rate for each parameter in this scenario is scaled to 0.1.",

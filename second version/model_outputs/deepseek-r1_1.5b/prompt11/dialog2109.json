    "model_response": "To classify emails as spam using Naive Bayes, we break down the problem into simple components:\n\n1. **File Extension and Metadata**: Examine the file extension (e.g., .docx) and metadata like sender domain or IP address. This helps identify patterns often associated with spam.\n\n2. **Content Patterns**:\n   - Look for personal data such as addresses or contact names.\n   - Identify overly lengthy content, which may indicate spam due to lack of purpose.\n\n3. **Criteria-Based Differentiation**: Use specific keywords in the subject line related to scams or promotions. This helps distinguish between legitimate and spam emails.\n\n4. **Bag of Words Model**: Represent each email as a bag of words, focusing on stop words and common phrases that often appear in non-spam content.\n\n5. **Weighted Scoring System**: Assign weights based on how much each criterion contributes to spam detection, ensuring balanced contributions from all factors.\n\nBy evaluating these components using Naive Bayes, emails can be accurately classified as spam or non-spam.",

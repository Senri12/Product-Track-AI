    "model_response": "To classify emails as spam using a Naive Bayes model, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Data Collection**: Gather a labeled dataset of emails, ensuring each email is classified as spam or not spam.\n\n2. **Preprocessing**:\n   - Clean the data: Remove unwanted characters and convert to a consistent format.\n   - Normalize: Handle URLs, special characters, and remove non-English words if necessary.\n   - Extract features: Use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe) to capture important words.\n\n3. **Feature Selection**: Include keyword presence, common spam words, and other relevant features that influence classification.\n\n4. **Model Training**:\n   - Split data into training and test sets.\n   - Train the Naive Bayes classifier using probability calculations for each feature's likelihood ratio.\n\n5. **Evaluation**:\n   - Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score to assess performance.\n   - Analyze confusion matrices to identify patterns where predictions are off.\n\n6. **Improvement and Considerations**:\n   - Address challenges with feature extraction (e.g., handling multiple languages).\n   - Determine if more data is needed or if fine-tuning is required for smaller datasets.\n\nBy following these steps, you can develop a Naive Bayes spam classifier that effectively identifies unwanted emails based on text features.",
